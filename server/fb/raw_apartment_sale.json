Amazing testimony is the wooden carved and painted ceiling in the entrance. All the building was totally restored and the works finished in 2006. Via Scrimiari n.6 it means only 500m. to Piazza Erbe and 800m. to Piazza Bra (the most famous squares of the town) in the oldest area of Verona where the first inhabitants settle down and start to build what would become one of the most beautiful, stunning and spectacular cities all over Italy. Arena, Castel Vecchio, Basilica di San Zeno and Teatro Romano are only some examples for which this town is the 4^ most visited in Italy from turists (after Venice, Florence and Rome). The name \u201cScrimiari\u201d takes probably origin from the several workshops (in 1.700 were located above all here) specialized creating and selling caskets (scrigno in Italian language). The road is quiet and only one way, but anyway the apartment appears in the inner side of the buiding. You\u2019ll see roofs and other old buildings in an absolute silent atmosphere, feeling to live in countryside and not in a noisy town. \n\nAs said the building finished to be complitly restored in 2006 and the apartment was totally remade on the project of a creative Architect that changed all the plans giving a modern a minimalist style even for the furnishings advised to the owner. Simplicity, design and good taste that all mixed together give the pleasant feeling to be in a very friendly and cozy place called Home.

It lies just south of Valletta, Malta\u2019s capital, and is approximately 5 km away from the international airport.  SmartCity Malta is a purpose-built, state-of-the-art economic centre developed to incorporate all the essential elements organisations need to excel, all set in environmentally friendly surroundings. For more details on Smart City visit http:\/\/malta.smartcity.ae The land value in the next decade is expected to rise.\n \nAdditional Information on Haz-Zabbar \n\u0126a\u017c-\u017babbar is bound to the north by Kalkara and Xg\u0127ajra, to the west by Fgura and Cottonera fortifications (enclosing the localities of Vittoriosa and Cospicua - the Historical Three Cities), to the east by Marsaskala.  \n\nThe town was used as an encampment by the Ottoman armies at the outset of the Great Siege and later as a base by the Maltese insurgents against French rule in around 1800. A memorable battle took place in front of the \u0126a\u017c-\u017babbar Sanctuary. To this day, French-era cannonballs are to be seen in household walls in the city's older parts and some are also in the church museum after being retrieved from the old church dome.  \u0126a\u017c-\u017babbar was granted city status by the last Grand Master on Malta, Ferdinand de Hompesch, in whose name the population built a triumphal arch on the main approach road from Paola through Fgura.  During the British era a number of forts and batteries were built in the area. These were Fort St Rocco, Fort St Leonardo, Delle Grazie Battery and Zonqor Battery. Fort St Rocco was built between 1873 and 1875. It was later expanded and 3 cannons were fitted. Also, Fort St leonardo was fitted with 4 cannons. These two forts took care of the neighboring seas. The two batteries also took care of the area altogether with the Rinella battery which contains the famous 100 ton Armstrong Gun.\n \nAdditional Information on the Historical Three Cities\nThe Three Cities offer an intriguing insight into Malta and its history. Left largely unchanged, these cities area slice of authentic life as well as a glimpse into Malta's maritime fortunes. The Three Cities can rightly claim to be the cradle of Maltese history, as Vittoriosa, Senglea and Cospicua have provided a home and fortress to almost every people who settled on the Islands. Their harbour inlets have been in use since Phoenician times: the docks always providing a living for local people, but also leaving them vulnerable when Malta's rulers were at war. As the first home to the Knights of St. John, the Three Cities' palaces, churches, forts and bastions are far older than Valletta's. The local communities here celebrate holy days and festas as nowhere else on the Islands. The most spectacular events are the Easter processions when statues of the \"Risen Christ\" are carried at a run through crowded streets.\n \nAdditional Information on il-Kalkara\nIl-Kalkara is a small picturesque village in Malta, with a population of 2,999 as of March 2011. The village of Kalkara developed as a small fishing community around the sheltered inlet of Kalkara Creek. Some historians believe that the land that today is known as Kalkara, was one of the first to be inhabited by the initial dwellers of Malta that came from nearby island of Sicily. The idea behind this theory is that the inlets of the Grand Harbour could have provided these primitive emigrants with the needed shelter after having endured their long voyage in the Mediterranean Sea. Nevertheless such theories cannot be proven and Kalkara's early history will remain largely unknown.\n\nKalkara is located on the eastern coast of Malta and forms part of the inner harbour area of the Grand Harbour. It occupies the area around Kalkara Creek and extends to both valley sides around the creek. Rinella Bay, the only sandy beach in the Grand Harbour, is found at the mouth of the Rinella valley. Kalkara is one of the few localities within the Grand Harbour area which still has relatively large open spaces which naturally divide it from other towns and villages.","id":"241355299235344"},{"name":"Apartment for Sale Costa Del Sol, Andalucia","description":"Apartment 7I in Flamingo Golf for Sale\n\nPrice Reduced from 180,000 euro to 134,900 euro to sell\n\nContact me on 00353868145539 or email on flamingogolfrental@gmail.com\n\nBuilt - 100 sqm\n3 Beds - 2 baths\nBalcony - 7 sqm\n\n\nLocated in Riviera, Mijas Costa, Costa Del Sol\nApartment coomplex completed 2003\nBasement carparking with electronic key access\nOwn storage lockup in basement\nSafe gated community with intercom access.\nAdult and Childrens pools.\nOpen plan living room with fireplace\nLarge balcony.\nModern kitchen.\nSea Views - Beach approx 4km away.\nIdeal for families, small groups or individuals.\nGolf course and driving range approx 1km away\nExtensive array of quality courses within short distance.\n","id":"174927092623530"},{"name":"Mieszkanie na sprzeda\u017c \/ Apartment for sale","description":"Do sprzedania nowo urz\u0105dzone, ciche mieszkanie z klimatycznym, s\u0142onecznym ogrodem, po\u0142o\u017cone w Miasteczku Wilan\u00f3w w eleganckim budynku przy ul.

This poem is a gift and I want you to keep it\" \"I once had a broker named bad vlad Times with him were happy and sad. We started on the east, After we enjoyed a McDonald's feast, And close comrades we became at once. After murray hill showed us no love, Vlad looked to the heavens above. Told the agents to stop scheming, To keep on believing, And to start our journey out west. At onset there was resistance from the team. Vlad insisted the west was our dream, Gyms and doormen, renovations and more, The ultimate spot to bring back my whores. After finding a spot on 56th, Vlad tells me our offer doesn't exist. More scheming he said, But don't hang your head, We'll find your pimp palace this week. At conclusion of apartment crisis 2012, We continued our search in the kitchen of hells. One place was all it took, Rather gave it a second look, And we decided to finally settle down. Our long journey had ended, A Bulgarian we friended, And we found a place to call home, But at the end of the day, I wouldn't have had it any other way, In our triumphant battle of choosing a place to stay. All the time spent doodling, Don't know who the landlords thought they were fooling, Because we were riding with the best, Vladimir Kulagin. \n\n- John Gallotta July 15th, 2012,   \n\n\nVlad, You are the brother I never had. I would take a bullet in the arm Or leg for you. There are less than 3200 wild tigers in the world, and you are one of them. You are welcome at PH9 365 days a year! Love, Alex \n\n- Alex Lupica July 15th, 2012\n\nVlad, You are a God living among mere mortals. I''d follow you to the gates of Avalon. If I know anyone living in NYC, you are the first and only real estate I''d recommend! \n\n- John Rather, July 15, 2012\n\n\n\u201cVladimir Kulagin was absolutely wonderful! Both my roommate and I were looking to move into the city from other areas. We knew the area we wanted to live in, and the price we were willing to pay, but expected very little in terms of what we would find. Vladimir was in constant contact with us from the beginning of our search and was very assuring that we wouldn't necessarily have to lower our standards. The very first apartment he showed us was the one we moved into -- the building was way more luxurious than we were expecting and the rent was within our budget! Vladimir was dedicated to helping us settle on this apartment we wanted, and was in constant dialogue with us throughout the application process. He made himself available to us at all hours of the day and night to answer questions and ensure that we were on the right track. His extensive knowledge of the NYC housing market combined with his honest and friendly demeanor made us extremely comfortable and confident that we were settling on the best choice available. We would absolutely recommend him to anyone looking to buy or rent in the city.\u201d \n\n-Alexi Noelle and Marilyn Mereles\nFebruary 02, 2012\n\n\nI met Vladimir when looking for an apartment to rent in Manhattan.In our first meeting, Vladimir was extremely prepared and showed us exactly the apartments that met our criteria and budget.We were able to finalize a place at the end of the same day. Vladimir\u2019s professionalism and knowledge of the Manhattan rental\/ purchase market is incomparable, which is why I sought his help when I was ready to buy a condo.Once again Vladimir did not disappoint and we were able to finalize a place within days of our search.Both of my experiences with Vladimir have been exceptional and I would recommend his expertise to anyone. \n\n- Nikita February 09, 2011\n","id":"107257979321385"},{"name":"Homes For Sale in Astoria Queens NY - Apartments for Rent in Astoria Queens","id":"244322658937619"},{"name":"Apartments for sale in Paphos","description":"If you are willing to buy an apartment, house or any other type of property in Paphos, Prime Property Group will be glad to help you find the finest option on the real estate market of the island.
