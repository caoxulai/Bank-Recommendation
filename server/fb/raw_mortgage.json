However, as markets for mortgages have become more competitive, the role of the mortgage broker has become more popular. Today in most developed mortgage markets (especially in Canada, the U.S., the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Spain), mortgage brokers are the largest sellers of mortgage products for lenders.Mortgage brokers exist to find a bank or a direct lender that an individual seeks with a specific loan the individual is seeking. Mortgage brokers in Canada are paid by the lender and do not charge fees for good credit applications.The majority of mortgage brokers are regulated to ensure compliance with banking and or finance laws in the jurisdiction of the consumer; however, the extent of the regulation depends on the jurisdiction. Only one state within the U.S. has no laws that govern mortgage lending.Duties of a mortgage brokerBanking activities can be divided into the following:  Retail banking: dealing directly with individuals and small businesses  Business banking: providing services to mid-market business  Corporate banking: directed at large business entities  Land mortgage banking: it specializes in originating and\/or serving land mortgage loans Private banking: providing wealth management services to high-net-worth individuals and families  Investment banking: relating to activities on the financial markets Most banks are profit-making, private enterprises, however, some are owned by government, or are non-profits. Central banks are normally government-owned banks, which are often charged with quasi-regulatory responsibilities, e.g. supervising commercial banks, or controlling the cash interest rate.

With over 20 years experience I've helped thousands of clients with their home loan needs. Having worked in the local Parramatta area since 1998, I understand the local property market and the needs of First Home Buyers, those who are looking to refinance their existing loan and Property Investors.\n\nFirst Home Buyers\nIf you don't have the knowledge and understanding of the process of arranging your home loan, don't be concerned. My job is to find the most cost effective home loan option for you. I'll review hundreds of loans from dozens of lenders and will work with you throughout the process from interview, to lodging the application. I'll liaise with the lenders to keep you up to date with how the loan is progressing all the way through to settlement.\nYou may be pleasantly surprised at the cost buying your first home when compared to what you may be paying in rent.\n\nRefinancing\nWhether you need to move, looking to reduce your repayments or fix your loan, or need to renovate your existing property I'd like to sit down with you to asses your home loan needs. I've helped hundreds of people refinance their home loan. Competition in the market is strong at the moment and with the recent reductions in interest I'd be surprised if I could not find you a better home loan deal.\n\nProperty Investors\nThe world post GFC has made investing in the share market volatile and unpredictable. The good news for investors is that the rental property market will remain tight for the foreseeable future. If you'd like to find out how rising rental yields and the relative safety of investing in property could work you give me a call.\n\nI have access to industry respected property reports that may be able to assist you in the purchasing process in all suburbs including Parramatta, Harris Park, Greystanes , Merrylands, Merrylands West, Granville, Holroyd, Toongabbie, Old Toongabbie, Girraween, Mays Hill, Pemulwuy, Pendle Hill, Dundas, Dundas Valley, Oatlands, Telopea, Ermington, Rosehill, Rydalmere .\n\nContact me today on 02 9630 6888 or mobile 0438258888.\n\nThis Facebook business page belongs to Mortgage Choice in Parramatta which is owned and operated independently by registered business name.

It's a partnership that combines the largest independently owned bank in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota with the tri-state area's largest private mortgage company - and one of the oldest in the country.\n\nWith its 130 years of history, Bell has proven that progressive, service-oriented business stands the test of time. Quite simply put, Bell Mortgage has been a part of Minnesota since its infancy. Five years before the first motorized car rolled down the street, 47 years before a young inventor applied for a patent on his \"image dissector\" or television, and years before our time - Bell Mortgage has been in the business of improving lives.\n\nThe history of Bell Mortgage dates back to 1858, when David C. Bell made Minneapolis home. Bell earned $25 a month in his first job, working as a clerk at a small general store on the south side of Nicollet Avenue. Later, Bell took on an admirable number of ventures starting with a stint as Hennepin County Treasurer. Soon he co-founded the YMCA, the American Automobile Association, a linseed oil company, several banks and ultimately a mortgage company under his name - David C. Bell Investment Company.\n\nIn 1880, Bell began originating mortgages in Minnesota and sold them to banks in New York. The first mortgage bond from the David C. Bell Investment Company was drawn up in 1888 for the sum of $3,500. The business Bell began not only employed numerous Minnesotans, it also brought a significant amount of money and development into the area. Perhaps that is why Mr. Bell is referred to, not only as an entrepreneur, but also one of the Twin Cities' founding fathers.\n\nThe David C. Bell Company continued to flourish, weathering The Great Depression, two World Wars and embracing nearly 100 years of local development before its purchase in 1980 by Gary Kirt. Kirt, known for his entrepreneurial spirit, has kept Bell on the cutting edge of trends in the mortgage industry as well as the pursuit of world-class technology solutions for its customers and employees. Bell's technology leads employees and customers from loan application to closing with efficiency and ease, simplifying a process that both processors and customers often consider difficult.\n\nBell continues to push the envelope via its proprietary systems and in turn, customers of Bell have access to numerous loan options and programs not typically available through other mortgage bankers.\n\nAnother staple at Bell is the way its employees do business, always putting the customer's needs first, while ensuring regulatory compliance. Kirt says Bell's reputation for ethical business conduct helps explain the organization's longevity and respect from its customers and competitors alike.\n\nAdditionally, Bell continues to forge positive relationships in the community through its active role in local charities including Simpson Housing Services, which provides a haven for homeless people in the Twin Cities. Bell not only gives financial support, but its employees also provide, prepare and serve hot meals monthly at Simpson - an activity Bell has taken part in for over 20 years.\n\nThe Boys and Girls Clubs of the Twin Cities also holds a special place in Mr. Kirt's heart. In fact, he spent many nights at the club as a child. Consequently, Kirt has been serving on the club's Board of Directors since 1980. Bell also provides financial support to the Boys and Girls Clubs and employees donate their time serving dinners on a regular basis.\n\nDuring the holidays, Bell employees have opted not to spend money on each other; rather they purchase gifts through the Hennepin County Children, Family and Adult Services Department. The organization is dedicated to low-income adults and mentally or physically challenged people in the Minneapolis area.\n\nA commitment to community spanning three centuries, the constant pursuit of cutting-edge technology, the best combination of products, prices and service, all backed by the experience and dedication of the best mortgage team in the country- that's Bell Mortgage and has been for over 130 years.\n\nNow a division of Bell State Bank & Trust, Bell Mortgage has 180 employees at 28 mortgage offices in the Twin Cities area, Bozeman, Mont., and Phoenix, Ariz., and, with its long history, more than 500,000 family mortgages to its name. \n\nChartered in 1966, Bell State Bank & Trust has 20 full-service bank locations in Fargo, West Fargo and Wahpeton, North Dakota, and Alexandria, Audubon, Breckenridge, Detroit Lakes, Dilworth, Fergus Falls, Hawley, Minneapolis, Pelican Rapids, Wahpeton, and Woodbury, Minnesota. We also have trust offices in Bismarck and Boise, Idaho. \n\nBell Mortgage, a division of Bell State Bank & Trust is a Member FDIC, Equal Employment Opportunity Employer and an Equal Housing Lender (We lend without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status). Trust & Investment services are not FDIC insured, have no bank guarantee, may lose value, not a deposit and not insured by federal government agency.\n\nRealize your comments are visible to the world, so avoid sharing your personal account information.

I am an IBRC Mortgage Holder and the person behind the IBRC mortgage holders strike page on Facebook. \nI set up the page shortly after I took part in a protest outside the dail with other IBRC mortgage holders. That was in February of this year.\nI filmed interviews with 5 TD\u2019s that day. Four suggested pressure and protest. Luke Flanagan suggested a mortgage strike. \n\nWhat he said made perfect sense to me.  I went and set up the IBRC Mortgage Holders strike page on Facebook. I thought that the idea would gain support from a large number of IBRC Mortgage Holders. I was wrong about that. \n\nThe strike received little or no support. I spent money to promote the page on facebook to get it out to as big an audience as possible. I posted articles which were relevant to mortgage holders. \nThere were a lot of likes, comments and shares but very little support for the strike. I started to look at other options. I sought advice from Tom Darcy. Tom has been in the high court 27 times and in the supreme court many times as well, all as a lay litigant. He won a case against AIB.\nI also went to the Hub. They are a voluntary organization with an office in Dublin and I hear THEY ARE OPENING IN GALWAY. The Hub offer help to people in trouble with mortgages. I received great advice from the HUB and Elizabeth Hourihane regarding seeking a judicial review of the IBRC legislation.\nI believe that if a large group of IBRC Mortgage holders came together in one group . That group would have a lot of power to negotiate. In my opinion there are 3 options open to such a group. Here are the 3 options in no particular order.\n\nStart a mortgage strike\n\nSeek an interlockutory injunction to stall the sale of the remaining mortgages. Possibly a judicial review of the ibrc liquidation legislation. \nThe third option is to use the strength of the group to negotiate with IBRC on a writedown. If we were say 1000 strong with the average mortgage at 100,000 that is 100 million. \nOthers have already gotten write downs on big amounts like that. We are being told that they can not deal with individual mortgage holders. How could they refuse to negotiate with us if we had 100 million in mortgage debt to negotiate with.?\nIf you are an IBRC mortgage holder and you would like become a member just send a message  to this page IBRC Mortgage Holders Strike to say that you wish to become a member of the group.\n The message can be either public or private. I will publish on the page just the numbers that joining up weekly. You do not have to sign anything or pay any money. This will be in informal group .\nSoon I will call a meeting where we can consider our options and vote on them. \nOn May 31 st we had our first meeting at the red cow hotel in Dublin. There were 15 people in the room. It was a very good meeting. Tom Darcy gave an excellent presentation and hosted a question and answer session. There was good debate and exchange of information. \nA couple who were at the meeting had a sad story to tell. They and their 4 children were facing eviction. Fortunately we were able to help them. Noel Bropy and Davey Walsh of debt solutions in carrick on suir and Brian Kavanagh and myself were at the court with them last Wednesday. The case was adjourned for six months.\nIt was a real eye opener for me to see people who were distraught about the loss of their family home. The smiles on their faces outside the court last wednesday was a joy to behold. They are now working with debt solutions and considering their next move.\nTheir story made me realize that there are a lot of mortgage holders out there in difficulties and they simply do not know where to turn. If you are one of those people please contact this page and I will do my best to refer you on to people who can help like the hub or debt solutions\n\nI would like to appeal to the other IBRC groups to stand with us.  It makes sense for us to come together. The bigger our number the more powerful we become.\n \n\n If this can work for IBRC Mortgage holders it can work for mortgage holders with other banks as well. If other groups are formed they will also be in a strong position to negotiate. And then if all the groups joined together we would be in a very strong position to negotiate.\n\nI believe there is a real opportunity here to take back control of our mortgages \nThere is benefit accrueing to privately owned unregulated vulture funds through the sale of Irish mortgages. Why can that benefit not be given to the Irish mortgage holders themselves. It would be an enormous benefit to all concerned including the economy.\n\n\n","id":"675063852540469"},{"name":"Gary Akali Commercial Mortgages Truck & Equipment Leasing Expert","id":"862486983816210"},{"name":"Primary Residential Mortgage, Inc. - Chandler Branch","id":"296226967197300"},{"name":"Mortgage Architects - Kalson Jang","description":"Finding the best mortgage can be an intimidating task.

The greatest advantage of being a broker is we get lower rates (wholesale rates) from National Lenders.  That\u2019s because the lender has much less overhead expenses because they don\u2019t pay the loan officers to sell their products.   Since Frank R Cwalina II is a Sr. Loan Officer and the Owner of the company he does not have to split the commission with the sales manager and owner like all other loan officers do.  Which in turn, allows him to offer lower rates and lower overall cost to his clients. That gives him a competitive advantage over his competition.

Many of these stated income loans were the catalyst to the ultimate failure of Ameriquest itself, and a key factor in the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis.Prior to its failure, Ameriquest was widely known in the United States through its promotional activity. It advertised widely on television, had blimps that flew over football and baseball stadiums, and sponsored the Rolling Stones (2005 U.S. tour), the Super Bowl XXXIX Halftime show, and NASCAR drivers. Its ad slogan is \"proud sponsor of the American dream,\" and their company motto was to \"do the right thing.\" Additionally, in their commercials, Ameriquest also reiterated more than once that their customers are \"more than a number.\" This is, of course, in reference to potential borrowers who may have had poor credit but were able to find financing with Ameriquest.","id":"105725269462283"},{"name":"The Mortgage Outlaw","description":"Do you want to stay up-to-date with mortgage news, housing updates and be educated on the home lending process?
