Generally, holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or tradition of cultural or religious significance. Holidays may be designated by governments, religious institutions, or other groups or organizations. The degree to which normal activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job being held, or even personal choices.The concept of holidays has most often originated in connection with religious observances. The intention of a holiday was typically to allow individuals to tend to religious duties associated with important dates on the calendar. In most modern societies, however, holidays serve as much of a recreational function as any other weekend days or activities.In many societies there are important distinctions between holidays designated by governments and holidays designated by religious institutions. For example, in many predominantly Christian nations, government-designed holidays may center around Christian holidays, though non-Christians may instead observe religious holidays associated with their faith. In some cases, a holiday may only be nominally observed. For example, many Jews in the Americas and Europe treat the relatively minor Jewish holiday of Hanukkah as a \"working holiday\", changing very little of their daily routines for this day.The word \"holiday\" has some variance in meaning across different locales. In North America the word refers to widely observed days of rest and recreation, whereas in the U.K. and many Commonwealth nations the word refers to any extended period of recreation. It is this first, more restricted sense of the word that concerns this article.EtymologyThe word holiday comes from the Old English word h\u0101ligd\u00e6g (h\u0101lig \"holy\" + d\u00e6g \"day\"). The word originally referred only to special religious days. In modern use, it means any special day of rest or relaxation, as opposed to normal days away from work or school.","id":"112045855481865"},{"name":"Vacation ZA","description":"At Vacation ZA we are enthusiastic about moulding your travel needs and wishes with our extensive experience and knowledge gained through our partners.

People often take a vacation during specific holiday observances, or for specific festivals or celebrations. Vacations are often spent with friends or family.A person may take a longer break from work, such as a sabbatical, gap year, or career break.The concept of taking a vacation is a recent invention, and has developed through the last two centuries. Historically, the idea of travel for recreation was a luxury that only wealthy people could afford (see Grand Tour). In the Puritan culture of early America, taking a break from work for reasons other than weekly observance of the Sabbath was frowned upon. However, the modern concept of vacation was led by a later religious movement encouraging spiritual retreat and recreation. The notion of breaking from work periodically took root among the middle and working class.EtymologyIn the United Kingdom, vacation once specifically referred to the long summer break taken by the law courts and then later the term was applied to universities. The custom was introduced by William the Conqueror from Normandy where it facilitated the grape harvest. In the past, many upper-class families moved to a summer home for part of the year, leaving their usual home vacant.","id":"115135421831199"},{"name":"Exploring Vacations","description":"Exploring Vacations specialise in Self-Drive Tours, Private Escorted Tours, Coach Tours and City Breaks for Ireland, Scotland and The UK ","id":"158474257503740"},{"name":"Vacation","id":"183234071708539"},{"name":"Vacation Village Cottages\/Chalets","id":"708639415825371"},{"name":"Honeymoon Vacation","description":"Honey Vacation is an established travel agent operating in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Cary Judd was working on what was originally intended as a solo album.  After renting a small office in a complex to work on the album, he reached out to Conor Souhrada, a sound designer he\u2019d made friends with through his job at a local music store to occupy an empty office in the same complex.  Over the course of the summer they began collaborating on each other\u2019s projects.  In a short time, they dubbed their work space, \u201cThe Wormhole Studio\u201d, which quickly became a respected studio and production house in the Boise, ID area.    \n\nAs Judd\u2019s work on the album progressed, he found himself knocking on Conor\u2019s door more and more frequently to help generate sounds and give advice on production.   Judd had originally thought of The Vacationist as the title for his solo album, but as production continued it was clear that a new band was organically evolving.  As the album progressed, the duo recruited some of their friends from other local bands to add to the album.\n\nSam Carrier of A Sea of Glass fame pitched in on filling out guitar-soundscapes and riffing and writing with Cary and Conor.  Sunnie Lynne, Cary's partner and well known photographer was then enlisted as a band member\/live production designer.\n\nSam continues to make appearances with TVAC as a live guitar player along with Scot Alexander (on loan from Dishwalla).\n\nThe sound and lyrical content of The Vacationist is inspired by the interests in physics, spirituality, and humanity\u2019s place in the cosmos.  These elements are painted over sprawling soundscapes with heart pounding rhythms to create The Vacationist sound.\n\nThe self-titled debut was released on January 1, 2015.","id":"893376644011706"},{"name":"Anantara Vacation Club Phuket Mai Khao","description":"The Anantara Vacation Club has been crafted especially to create a destination experience.

The TV movie follows the McDonald-Venturi family as the children are forced to spend part of their summer vacation with their grandmother at her lodge. It was announced on Family Channel and French-Canadian channel VRAK.TV in March 2010 that the movie would premiere on June 25, 2010 in Canada, while December 12, 2010 is listed in the trailer for the US, but never actually aired when it was supposed to. However, the movie finally began airing on Starz Kids & Family in January 2011 in the U.S. A commercial on Nickelodeon Australia stated that it would premiere on June 19, 2010. A commercial on TG4 stated the Irish premiere would be on the channel Thursday October 28, 2010 at 5:10\u00a0p.m., part of the channel's Mid-Term Halloween movie week.PlotCasey and Derek are back but nothing has changed, they are still at each other's throats, and still have sibling rivalry. The only good thing about it all is that it's summer vacation, and everyone is planning on going on a trip to Casey and Lizzie's grandmother's lakefront lodge for the summer. But their plans get a little messed up when Derek is forced into going by his dad. Things get even more messed up when Casey has to ride with Derek to the Blue Heron Lodge. On their way up there they get pulled over by the cops, meanwhile Edwin, Lizzie, Marti, Nora and George have already arrived. They soon find out that when Nora's mom said she wanted her grandchildren to visit, she meant her blood grandchildren, but agrees to let them stay, while George and Nora head for Montreal. Soon Derek and Casey get to the lodge but get stopped by Edwin who informs them about what's happened. After this, Derek says he wants to leave, Casey takes his keys, and he starts running after her. That's when Derek meets Felicia. One thing leads to another and Derek stars dating the competing lodge's daughter, then he soon realizes that it wasn't the best thing to be doing, and he breaks up with her. Meanwhile, Casey meets Jesse, a waiter at the lodge dining area, and they both love to dance and start dancing. Meanwhile Edwin gets hurt, Lizzie meets a guy, and Marti finds a lizard. Soon one thing leads to another and they end up trying to save the lodge and they succeed. At the end they have a dance party, and it shows the ending credits then shows it a year later when the first McDonald-Venturi is born.

Cayucos (an Indian name for kayak or little canoe) gives visitors the rare experience of slowing down from life in the fast lane with miles of beautiful coastline, no stoplights, and a very slow pace of living that make this quaint beach town a place to remember and a place you will want to return to. It is one of the roads less traveled. You may wish to explore the shoreline, watch the whales, dolphins or seabirds, take a short or long hike, bicycle or kayak in the ocean or on the bay. There are many wineries nearby as well. Perhaps you prefer sport fishing. On the pier, in the surf, or on a boat out to sea, all offer the sport fisherman the best fishing has to offer. \n\nIf you are a golf enthusiast, there are many beautiful courses nearby. You will find several other activities on the inspiring, unspoiled Central Coast as well. If none of the above satisfy your desires for a dream vacation, perhaps you will become renewed, refreshed and enjoy doing nothing at all except relaxing here in Cayucos. The sea brings peace to the soul. \n\n","id":"123852104296689"},{"name":"Jersey Shore Vacations","description":"The New Jersey Shore is where vacation dreams come true.
