It is a story about the desire to build a home for every Filipino. To deservedly reward the hard work and perseverance of the Filipino family man. To give young families a place of their own where they can grow their dreams and tomorrows. To create communities where residents feel safe and feel they belong to.\n\nIt is also a story of evolution \u2013 from building some of the country\u2019s finest and most desired communities to today, building cities.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the master plan. In real estate parlance, the \u201cmaster plan\u201d is a comprehensive plan that guides the long-term physical development of a particular area. The Camella masterplans describe residential communities that are more than a composite of homes, streets, parks, and playgrounds. Camella believes that communities should bring whatever its families need within easy reach. Thus, each community is ideally located with immediate access to crucial institutions like schools, hospitals, churches, transport hubs, and places of leisure. They are close to business centers, so work is easy to get to, and come home from. But the group has taken this a step further and exploded that strategy by bringing the institutions right into the communities. Now, when Camella builds, it also builds churches, schools and commercial centers. By creating properties that are essentially self-contained, it is creating virtual cities.\n\nTo Camella, the master plan of every single community it builds, in every single location it selects, is a sacred, living blueprint that incorporates not only what the group intends to build, but what it intends to accomplish \u00ac\u2013 it intends to build cities; and since a country is often known by its cities \u2013 France is Paris. Japan is Tokyo. England is London. The USA is New York, Los Angeles and Miami \u00ac\u2013 by building communities where they are needed, and by creating the foundations for tomorrow\u2019s cities, Camella is building the country.\n\nBeyond creating practically self-contained communities, Camella developments have become a \u201cmark of progress\u201d across the country. Camella developments often portent movement into the town, city or province they come to \u2013 they portent growth and expansion. What was once quiet and sleepy becomes bustling and dynamic. Roads get better, commercial developments crop up, utilities are upgraded, transport increases, and possibilities become endless. Lives improve, dreams become bigger, needs diversify, expectations expand, and growth becomes inevitable.\n\nThroughout history, this is exactly how the great cities of the world came to be. A germ, a seed, set growth in motion. A few homes built along a river evolve into a great city. A tiny market along a roadway becomes a town that becomes a metropolis. A community is designed for the future and built to respond to what is needed today, and what will be needed to tomorrow \u00ac\u2013 and slowly, and surely, a country will be built better.\n\n\u201cCamella. Building the Country,\u201d speaks of more than what the brand is all about, it speaks of what the brand promises to do.","id":"100503786802892"},{"name":"House sale and purchase","id":"253071904744572"},{"name":"Mackay House and Land Sales","description":"You know it when you see it ....\nThe perfect block of land for the perfect home ...\nFor the home of your dreams or the dream investment ...\nAnd the place to look is Mackay Land Sales ...\nWith a few estates to choose from ....\nFrom Budget to Prestige .....\nA visit to MackayLandSales.com.au can save you time, money and hassles ...\nYou see more land and options, so you'll see the block that is right for you, sooner .....\nMackayLandSales.com.au \n\nIt's all about choice ....\n","id":"154925844531829"},{"name":"CoachHouse Medical Ltd - Ultherapy UK Sales Agent","description":"What is Ultherapy?\n\nUltherapy is a non-surgical, non-invasive procedure that uses focused, targeted ultrasound and the body's own natural healing process to lift and tone loose skin on the brow, neck, under then chin and now the d\u00e9colletage.\n\nPatient Benefits:\nThe ONLY FDA-cleared, non-invasive ultrasound lifting treatment\n3 FDA-Clearances\n300,000 treatments worldwide to date\nLong lasting effects\nNo downtime after treatment.\n\nFind us on Twitter @UltherapyUK","id":"257061657814117"},{"name":"House and lot 4 SALE","id":"266516576795692"},{"name":"House's Auto Sales","description":"Used Car and Truck Dealer","id":"100458313445625"},{"name":"Apartment\/House for Rent, for Sale, Philippines","description":"We have Apartment\/House Units for Sale and with units ready for rent.

The house was bought by Judge Corwin in 1675, when he was 24 years old, and he lived there for more than forty years. Corwin is buried in the nearby Broad Street Cemetery. The house remained in the Corwin family until the mid-19th century. The Witch House is located at 310 Essex Street, at the cross streets of North & Summer in the Chestnut Street District of Salem.As a local magistrate and civic leader, Corwin was called upon to investigate the claims of diabolical activity when a surge of witchcraft accusations arose in Salem and neighboring communities. He took the place of Judge Nathaniel Saltonstall, who resigned after the execution of Bridget Bishop. Corwin served on the Court of Oyer and Terminer, which ultimately sent nineteen to the gallows. All nineteen refused to admit to witchcraft and maintained their innocence.The house is an excellent example of 17th-century architecture. To this day historians have not come to a conclusion as to when it was built. Jonathan Corwin's descendants claim the house was built in 1642. Some Victorian scholars alleged that the house was built between 1620\u20131630, and that Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island resided in the house in the 1630s.

Rent.ph would like to make it easier for owners and renters to connect with each other or with the assistance of real estate experts to enable the rental process shorter, more professionalized, personalized and transparent for both lessees and lessors.\n\nBacked by 2,000 real estate professionals officially affiliated with Rent.ph (and growing) spread across the country, owners can look for the nearest Rent Manager or agent where the property is located to help him market the property to prospects. Renters in search of properties can also seek the services of a Rent Manager or agent near him thus, reducing the effort and search time of renters and owners considerably.\n\nUnique also to the site are rental listings in the hospitality sector to address the search for transient or short-staying renters. We have included listings for hotels, apartelles and inns and other similar accommodations. Homestay listings are also underway as part of our effort to promote tourism in the country thus, the site is getting exciting-er every day.\n\nWith hundreds of listings posted everyday, and growing number of unique visitors daily, the site is also an effective advertising platform for property and rent-related products and services like furniture and home furnishings, logistics and moving-in services, cable, telecom, insurance and a host of other services in home living.\n\nTargeted advertising forms part of the core services in Rent.'s search algorithm. Our main and refine search tools provide a way to display only the most relevant property appropriate to the search.\n\nMore than anything else, Rent.ph would like to be acknowledged as a trusted leader in providing rent information to people who belong to this industry. In fact, we are among the very few in this domain, who invest in research and development to make the website not only reliable in terms of its rent database but also dependable in terms of rich and useful content.\n\n\tVision and Mission Statement\nWe envision ourselves to be the country's ultimate resource in property rental and rent information. Our mission is to establish the most innovative technology platform and best user-experience that bring renters, owners and property professionals together to make the property rental business more efficient, reliable and trustworthy.\n\n\tFirst in Features\nRent.ph is committed to bring the best technology to its users. It is the first property rental site that combines rental listing with rich media tools such as video embedding services which allows users to upload not only images, but also to display videos of their properties.\n\nIt is also the first property rental site in the world to integrate the QR Code system. A listed property property at Rent.ph is assigned a unique QR Code which can be printed out or circulated by email or shared in social networks. The QR code is specially useful to property owners when they need to advertise their property outdoors.\n\nLeveraging Google's map widget, Rent.ph is address-sensitive which accurately locates a property down to its street and barangay address.\n\nWe have also put up the nationwide weather guide to help renters decide the best time of day and week to move. Rent.ph's weather feature is location-sensitive. Whenever a renter searches a property in a particular province, forecast changes according to the weather in that area.\n\nAnother \"first\" in Rent.ph is its short messaging service where prospects can send text messages from the site to the property owner or agent's mobile phone.\n\nWe strive to be the first in everything both in technology and information resource to bring best rental experience to all Filipinos and expatriates.\n\nas seen on:\n-philstar.com\n-sunstar cebu\n-the freeman\n-philippine daily inquirer\n-business owrld online\n-expat newspaper\n-cebu daily news","id":"414256482052680"},{"name":"HOUSE for Sale FIJI Expressions of Interest","description":"Due to changes in family matters it has become necessary to sell our Fiji home.

Romeos offspring have all proved to be excellent riding horses, straight forward and uncomplicated. Romeo has now been gelded but is now owned by our yard manager who regularly competes him in all disciplines. Romeo was followed by Valentino another warm blood stallion who we leased for a couple of years and who was very successful competing in Dressage representing Britain in the home nations championships. We have several young stock by Valentino for sale at the moment  ranging from 2 - 5 years old.\n\nIn 2012 we bought Clonleigh Dancer a class one ID stallion who is available for stud this year. We currently have yearlings available for sale by Dancer and will be expecting 4 more foals by him this spring.\n\nAs well as breeding our own we regularly source horses, ponies and cobs from Ireland, we primarily purchase these to be used in our riding school, but these are also available to buy and are taken out to shows, ponyclub , riding club and hunting to continue their education and ensure they are versatile, experienced all rounders. \n\nAll our horses advertised for sale are open to vet and any other professional. We have excellent trial facilities including an indoor school, show jumps, cross country jumps and lovely hacking. \n\nWe don't believe in pressuring people to buy and encourage multiple viewings before people commit to buying, however we do not do loans, or loans with view to buy or allow our horses out on trial.
