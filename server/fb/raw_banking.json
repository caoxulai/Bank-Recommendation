Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial system and influence on national economies, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.Banking in its modern sense evolved in the 14th century in the rich cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world. In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties \u2014 notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs and the Rothschilds \u2014 have played a central role over many centuries.

As such, a more correct term for 'Islamic banking' is 'Sharia compliant finance'.Sharia prohibits acceptance of specific interest or fees for loans of money , whether the payment is fixed or floating. Investment in businesses that provide goods or services considered contrary to Islamic principles is also haraam . Although these prohibitions have been applied historically in varying degrees in Muslim countries\/communities to prevent unIslamic practices, only in the late 20th century were a number of Islamic banks formed to apply these principles to private or semi-private commercial institutions within the Muslim community.As of 2014, sharia compliant financial institutions represented approximately 1% of total world assets. By 2009, there were over 300 banks and 250 mutual funds around the world complying with Islamic principles and as of 2014 total assets of around $2 trillion were sharia-compliant. According to Ernst & Young, although Islamic Banking still makes up only a fraction of the banking assets of Muslims, it has been growing faster than banking assets as a whole, growing at an annual rate of 17.6% between 2009 and 2013, and will grow by an average of 19.7% a year to 2018.","id":"103121989727490"},{"name":"SSGRBCC-Legend In Banking","id":"1514878185390295"},{"name":"Banking current affairs","description":"Current affair plays an important role in getting success in any competitive exam, Specially Banking and other Gov.

What\u2019s appalling is how banks give you such a meager interest rate to hold your money. Yet to lend you the exact same dollar amount, the interest rate to borrow will certainly be ten, twenty, even thirty times more than what they\u2019ll pay on your deposits.\n\nThis interest rate spread is one way that banks profit. The other way is by the (\u201cvelocity of money\u201d effect or \u201cmultiple-use dollars\u201d effect). Due to fractional reserve lending, banks are actually able to lend that same dollar out multiple times. So take that same interest-rate spread and multiply it several times over.\n\nMost people flock to banks for safety and access to their money. For certain funds they\u2019re more concerned about the return of their principal than the return on their principal. They\u2019re willing to forego a reasonable growth rate and any tax advantages knowing they can get at their funds at any time for any reason. \n\nWhat if you could cut out the middleman and be your own bank throughout your whole life? To become your own banker you first need learn how the banks keep their reserves accessible without sacrificing certain tax advantages and opportunities for competitive growth. What if you could build this bank yourself and do so without taking on unpredictable market risk? And what if you could learn how to create this multiplier effect for your dollars on a much smaller scale and in a way that\u2019s much more fiscally responsible than fractional reserve lending?\nThe uses for this banking concept are infinite and can be repeated throughout your whole life to create more wealth for your family\u2019s financial goals.","id":"1612456292352225"},{"name":"Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC","description":"A Public Limited Liability Company incorporated in Sri Lanka on 6th March 1995\nunder the Companies Act No.17 of 1982 and re-registered under the Companies\nAct No.07 of 2007.A licensed commercial Bank under the Banking Act No.30 of \n1988 and listing in the Colombo Stock Exchange.\n\nFitch Ratings                       | 'BBB (lka)' (Stable Outlook) \nLanka Rating Agency Ltd. | 'BBB+ ' (Stable Outlook) \n","id":"189802867746890"},{"name":"TCF Bank Stadium","description":"TCF Bank Stadium is an outdoor stadium on the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.

Online banking is also referred as Internet banking, e-banking, virtual banking and by other terms.To access a financial institution's online banking facility, a customer with Internet access would need to register with the institution for the service, and set up some password for customer verification. The password for online banking is normally not the same as for telephone banking. Financial institutions now routinely allocate customers numbers , whether or not customers have indicated an intention to access their online banking facility. Customers' numbers are normally not the same as account numbers, because a number of customer accounts can be linked to the one customer number. The customer can link to the customer number any account which the customer controls, which may be cheque, savings, loan, credit card and other accounts. Customer numbers will also not be the same as any debit or credit card issued by the financial institution to the customer.To access online banking, a customer would go to the financial institution's secured website, and enter the online banking facility using the customer number and password previously setup. Some financial institutions have set up additional security steps for access to online banking, but there is no consistency to the approach adopted.FeaturesOnline banking facilities offered by various financial institutions have many features and capabilities in common, but also have some that are application specific.","id":"103103123063770"},{"name":"Banking Notes","description":"Dear Friends!

The earliest mention of the city is in the Amarna correspondence c.1350-1330 BCE as \"Bit-Lahmi\". The Hebrew Bible identifies it as the city David was from and where he was crowned as the king of Israel. The New Testament identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of Jesus. The city is inhabited by one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, although the size of the community has shrunk due to emigration. Bethlehem was destroyed by the Emperor Hadrian during the second-century Bar Kokhba revolt; its rebuilding was promoted by the Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, who commissioned the building of its great Church of the Nativity in 327 CE. The Church was badly damaged by the Samaritans, who sacked it during the Samaritan Revolt in 529, but was rebuilt a century later by the emperor Justinian I, in very much its present form.","id":"101880973186304"},{"name":"Titans Banking with Pinnacle Financial Partners","id":"251953104846098"},{"name":"Jos.

Services offered include savings and transactional accounts, mortgages, personal loans, debit cards, and credit cards. The term is generally used to distinguish these banking services from investment banking, commercial banking or wholesale banking. It may also be used to refer to a division or department of a bank dealing with retail customers.In the US the term Commercial bank is used for a normal bank to distinguish it from an investment bank. After the great depression, through the Glass\u2013Steagall Act, the U.S. Congress required that banks only engage in banking activities, whereas investment banks were limited to capital markets activities. This separation was repealed in the 1990s. Commercial bank can also refer to a bank or a division of a bank that mostly deals with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses, as opposed to individual members of the public (retail banking).","id":"113664298644141"},{"name":"Banking school","id":"749319631827042"},{"name":"Banking world","id":"812887715429288"},{"name":"Zambia Institute of Banking & Financial Services (ZIBFS)","description":"The Zambia Institute of Banking and Financial Services (ZIBFS) was established in 1992 with the objective of Promoting professionalism within the Banking and Financial Services Sector.\n\nThe Zambia Institute of Banking and financial services assumed all the functions initially performed by the Lusaka Branch of the Chartered Institute of Bankers, London.\n\nThe Zambia Institute of Banking and Financial Services is  an autonomous professional body with its own localised examination structure at Certificate, Diploma, Professional Diploma and Advanced Professional Diploma in Banking & Financial Services programmes.","id":"124373481003862"},{"name":"Banking on Montanans","id":"562783467142987"},{"name":"BPC Banking Technologies","description":"BPC is the world\u2019s leading provider of Open System, e-payment solutions for the global financial industry.

Reserves are held at the bank as currency, or as deposits in the bank's accounts at the central bank. Fractional-reserve banking is the current form of banking practiced in most countries worldwide.Fractional-reserve banking allows banks to act as financial intermediaries between borrowers and savers, and to provide longer-term loans to borrowers while providing immediate liquidity to depositors (providing the function of maturity transformation). However, a bank can experience a bank run if depositors wish to withdraw more funds than the reserves held by the bank. To mitigate the risks of bank runs and systemic crises (when problems are extreme and widespread), governments of most countries regulate and oversee commercial banks, provide deposit insurance and act as lender of last resort to commercial banks.Because bank deposits are usually considered money in their own right, and because banks hold reserves that are less than their deposit liabilities, fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond the amount of the underlying reserves of base money originally created by the central bank. In most countries, the central bank (or other monetary authority) regulates bank credit creation, imposing reserve requirements and capital adequacy ratios. This can limit the amount of money creation that occurs in the commercial banking system, and helps to ensure that banks are solvent and have enough funds to meet demand for withdrawals. However, rather than directly controlling the money supply, central banks usually pursue an interest rate target to control inflation and bank issuance of credit.","id":"115265345154553"},{"name":"Banking Guru Magazine - H","description":"\u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u0907\u0902\u0936\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0930\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0938 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0917\u0940 \u092a\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0913\u0902 \ufe58 \u090f\u0938\u092c\u0940\u0906\u0908 \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u0906\u0908\u092c\u0940\u092a\u0940\u090f\u0938 (\u092a\u0940\u0913\/\u0915\u094d\u0932\u0930\u094d\u0915), \u0906\u0930\u092c\u0940\u0906\u0908 (\u092a\u0940\u0913\/\u0915\u094d\u0932\u0930\u094d\u0915), \u090f\u0938\u094b\u0938\u093f\u090f\u091f \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 (\u092a\u0940\u0913\/\u0915\u094d\u0932\u0930\u094d\u0915) \u090f\u0932\u0906\u0908\u0938\u0940 (\u0905\u0938\u093f\u0938\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0902\u091f\/\u090f\u0913\/\u090f\u0921\u0940\u0913), \u090f\u0928\u0906\u0908\u0938\u0940\u090f\u0932 (\u0905\u0938\u093f\u0938\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0902\u091f\/\u090f\u0913\/\u090f\u0921\u0940\u0913) \u0907\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f \u0915\u0947 \u0905\u0924\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0924 \u0905\u0928\u094d\u092f \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u090f\u0917\u094d\u091c\u093e\u092e \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0937\u094d\u0920 \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0939\u0948 \ufe58 \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u0917\u0941\u0930\u0941\ufe31\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0917\u0940 \u092a\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0915\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u0916\u0915\u0930 \u0924\u0948\u092f\u093e\u0930 '\u0915\u0930\u0947\u0923\u094d\u091f \u0905\u092b\u0947\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0938' \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0915 \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940\u092f \u092e\u0941\u0926\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0941\u0916\u0924\u093e \u0926\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948\ufe31\n\u0915\u0930\u0947\u0923\u094d\u091f \u0905\u092b\u0947\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0915\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u091c\u0941\u095c\u0947 \u0924\u0940\u0928 \u092e\u0939\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923 \u0935\u093f\u0937\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0906\u0932\u0947\u0916 \u0915\u0947 \u0930\u0942\u092a \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u0916\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u094b \u0907\u0938 \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0915\u094b \u092c\u0947\u0939\u0924\u0930 \u092c\u0928\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948\ufe31\n\u0915\u0930\u0947\u0923\u094d\u091f \u0905\u092b\u0947\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0938 \u0915\u0947 \u0905\u0924\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0958\u094d\u0924 \u0938\u0949\u0932\u094d\u0935\u0921 \u092a\u0947\u092a\u0930\u094d\u0938 \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u092e\u0949\u0921\u0932 \u092a\u0947\u092a\u0930\u094d\u0938 \u0907\u0938 \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u0939\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\ufe31\nBOOSTERS \u0915\u0947 \u0930\u0942\u092a \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094d\u092f \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 \u0905\u0902\u0915\u0917\u0923\u093f\u0924 \u0905\u092d\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0917\u094d\u092f\u0924\u093e \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0924\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092a\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923 \u091c\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u092e\u0939\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923 \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u0905\u0927\u094d\u092f\u094d\u092f\u0928 \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0909\u092a\u0932\u092c\u094d\u0927 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u094b \u0905\u092d\u094d\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0938\u092c\u0938\u0947 \u0906\u0917\u0947 \u0930\u0916\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e \u0939\u0948\ufe31","id":"821966137862942"},{"name":"State bank of india internet banking & mobile banking","id":"265769386803231"},{"name":"Banking in Australia","id":"594694237333693"},{"name":"Banking Asprint","description":"Bank Exam Preparation\nJoining a Bank job has been the dream of millions of candidates for decades.  With a  vast branch expansion of both Public and Private Sector Banks, opportunities for bank jobs  increased several fold.  Mass retirement of bank staff has gained momentum now.  Hence, the number of bank vacancies to be filled in the next few years will be in lacs.  Thus, opportunities are available in plenty. However, it is for the candidates to make them fit - upto the level of  final selection.\nIBPS ( Institute of Banking Personnel Selection )  and SBI, pioneer in banking industry, have major role in filling these vacancies.  The expertise developed by IBPS in personnel selection over several decades, has made it possible to implement the Online Test process very smoothly and successfully.

Also, since the General Awareness is made available for one full year at an average monthly cost of only Rs 10\/- ( Rupees Ten only ), it will help them in preparing for the written exam as well as for the Interview.\nIn the case of both  Clerk and  PO examinations,  apart from knowledge,  speedier attending of the test assumes significance.

From its early origins in investment banking as City Securities Limited in 1977, FCMB (established in 1982) has emerged as one of the leading financial services institutions in Nigeria, one of the top eight lenders in the country with subsidiaries that are market leaders in their respective segments.\n\nFCMB was incorporated as a private limited liability company on April 20, 1982 and granted a banking licence on August 11, 1983. On July 15, 2004, the Bank changed its status from a private limited liability\n company to a public limited liability company and was listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange by introduction on December 21, 2004.\n \nThe Bank has witnessed virtually uninterrupted growth for 30 years and employs over 3000 employees.

In 2000, FCMB also received the inaugural Mergers and Acquisitions award in recognition of its expertise in this area. It has subsequently received the 2001 and 2002 award in the same category.\n\nFCMB is the first and only bank in Nigeria to have held these diverse awards at the same time, and remains the only institution to have won the Mergers and Acquisitions award for three consecutive years. In recent times the Bank has also received recognition for its successful forays outside investment banking, with nomination in 2009 for the most innovative bank in Africa by African Banker Magazine.\n\nOur business is structured along one market-facing division (Corporate Banking), three regions and six associated companies. The regions are Lagos & South West, South-South & South-East and Abuja & North and are responsible for the Retail, Commercial and Public Sector segments. \n\nFCMB\u2019s commitment is to be better for all our customers by continually being Simple, Reliable and Supportive to their businesses.

Among the first banks were the Bank of Hindustan, which was established in 1770 and liquidated in 1829-32; and the General Bank of India, established 1786 but failed in 1791.The largest bank, and the oldest still in existence, is the State Bank of India. It originated as the Bank of Calcutta in June 1806. In 1809, it was renamed as the Bank of Bengal. This was one of the three banks funded by a presidency government, the other two were the Bank of Bombay and the Bank of Madras. The three banks were merged in 1921 to form the Imperial Bank of India, which upon India's independence, became the State Bank of India in 1955. For many years the presidency banks had acted as quasi-central banks, as did their successors, until the Reserve Bank of India was established in 1935, under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.In 1960, the State Banks of India was given control of eight state-associated banks under the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959. These are now called its associate banks. In 1969 the Indian government nationalised 14 major private banks. In 1980, 6 more private banks were nationalised. These nationalised banks are the majority of lenders in the Indian economy. They dominate the banking sector because of their large size and widespread networks.","id":"138247272867208"},{"name":"Banking University of Ho Chi Minh City","description":"Banking University of Ho Chi Minh City is a university in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

With the changing environment of banking sector, BSC has undergone significant change. On one hand BSC has had to relinquish certain functions, it performed at the time when both interest and credit and foreign exchange was rigorously regulated. On the other hand, it has to reposition itself to the deregulated environment (while continuing to perform some old functions such as related to Export Finance Scheme) and be equipped to deal with a transformed Central Bank and banking system. The challenges posed by these changing requirements have been phenomenal but BSC has been steadily shifting its goals and objectives to align it with the new demands. Going forward, SBP is now working closely with BSC to develop a strategy for its further transformation to assign a more relevant Mission to it in line with the withdrawal of some of its old functions, consolidate the organization, fully automate its services and introduce a new culture of change management along with better enforcement of the performance management systems.

In Pakistan too, Islamic Banking is making inroads into conventional banking as more Islamic banks become operational. Recognizing the need for human resource development in the expanding field of Islamic Banking, University of Management and Technology has taken the lead in establishing the Institute of Islamic Banking (IIB) at its main campus at Lahore. Under the patronage of Dr Hasan Sohaib Murad, Rector UMT, it is a pioneering initiative as the new Institute embarks on an ambitious multidimensional program.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe University of Management and Technology (UMT) is committed to the noble task of dissemination of knowledge for the development of human beings enabling them to undertake divine responsibilities ensuing from their distinguished position as vicegerents (Khalifah) of God on earth. Besides compulsory courses in Islamic Studies at the undergraduate level, UMT also offers graduate courses to students to infuse in them the spirit of dedication for Islamic norms and values so that they not only excel in their worldly profession but also become practicing Muslims. As such, the teaching of Islamic Studies has a special place in the scheme of studies at UMT. Even before getting the university charter, two courses of Islamic Studies (3 credit hours each) were being offered at the Institute of Leadership and Management (ILM) as it was known at the time. The first course titled 'Islam and Personality' focused on the basic teachings of Islam and their role in developing a Muslim personality. The second course called 'Islam, Society and Systems' looked at Islam as a system of social governance offering solutions to contemporary issues and challenges faced by Muslim societies.\n\nThe IIB is simultaneously engaged at three major fronts. Its activities and programs are geared towards becoming a leading source of education, research and information in Islamic Banking. At the same time, IIB aims to become a self-sustaining arm of the University by generating substantial revenues through academic programs, consultancy and products sales. In the area of academic training and research, IIB is offering postgraduate degrees in three disciplines: Islamic Banking, Islamic Finance, and Islamic Economics. Moreover, with the participation of several reputed scholars from the Muslim world and elsewhere, IIB is ready to launch a refereed quarterly journal called Islamic Banking and Finance Review.\n\nIn order to fill the gap in trained manpower, IIB is launching a monthly series of Executive Development Programs for the banking industry. With the cooperation of UMT's Center for Management Development (CMD), these seminars will introduce the participants to the conceptual basis of Islamic Banking and how this can be translated into operational terms in this transition from conventional to Shariah based financial practices. Fully cognizant of the fact that HRD and R&D resources in Islamic Banking are in disarray for lack of a systematic approach, IIB intends to become a world leader in providing one-stop access to academic research, and human resources in Islamic Banking and Finance. To accomplish these goals, IIB has initiated several projects to develop retrospective and current bibliography, glossary, monographs, database, and a digital library on Islamic Banking.","id":"1495540277329378"},{"name":"Banking and Investments Association - BIA","description":"BIA's mission: \n\n\"To serve as a platform for students to connect and foster the growth of student empowerment in business related fields\" \n","id":"1452404795018542"},{"name":"Banking","description":"VAY TI\u1ec0N NHANH-L\u00c3I SU\u1ea4T TH\u1ea4P t\u1eeb c\u00e1c ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng Vietnam.\nth\u1ee7 t\u1ee5c photo nhanh gon.\nLH 0979.184.637","id":"763258123725520"},{"name":"Banking knowledge","id":"1006578429369893"},{"name":"Bank Syariah Mandiri","description":"Follow us on twitter @syariahmandiri","id":"81425927500"},{"name":"Bangkok Bank","description":"Bangkok Bank Public Company Limited , is a Thai commercial bank with approximately US$78 billion in total assets .

While lying in a hospital bed after a major heart attack, Edgar Cahn, a civil rights lawyer and speech writer for Robert Kennedy, was feeling helpless - similar to the disenfranchised and unemployed. This experience gave him the idea to create a new system of money as a tool to connect people and neighbors called Time Dollars. With this new idea several individuals begin forming time banks in their neighborhoods. The word spreads fast as people are hungry for this new way of exchange that doesn't involve cash, but instead taps into the capacity of their local community. Living with this new complimentary currency, time bankers discover the power of networking with their neighbors. With using the time dollars as currency, members bring improvement to their personal lives. This spirit of improvement grows into the greater community with larger-scaled time bank projects. Time bankers become part of the larger community projects giving them ownership in the effort and empowering them to give direction in their community. City officials and policy makers start to realize the positive differences in their areas and give recognition to the contribution that time banks are making. With all the popularity that time banks have achieved, the uncertainty of longevity after an economic upturn comes into question on whether or not people still need time banks when money is no longer scarce. However, time bankers have realized the connection to neighbors and the bonds with their community are more valuable than the money saved. Edgar Cahn, in his campaign for a collective force for system change, visits Los Angeles where time bank leaders from across the nation converge to learn from each other and organize a national advocacy voice.","id":"527207094030234"},{"name":"Mortgage Banking Bound","id":"1627397837493935"},{"name":"Emirates Institute for Banking and Financial Studies (EIBFS)","id":"355064246499"},{"name":"Banking, SSC & Other Govt Exams Preparation","description":"Are you preparing for Banking, SSC and other JOB related Entrance Examinations?

In accordance with the CBO regulations, the Bank has adopted a \u201cBank within the Bank\u201d model for its Islamic Banking operations. Islamic Banking operations have been planned to officially start its operations by the mid-year. The Bank has adopted a strategy where it plans to tailor its products observing customer behavior and overall market reaction on the Islamic banking products that early movers have offered in Oman. This is expected to closely meet customer needs and demands.The unique feature of Islamic Banking that distinguishes it from the existing conventional banking streams is the Shari\u2019a compliance governance structure that consists of Shari\u2019a Supervisory Board and Shari\u2019a Audit and Compliance Department. Shari\u2019a Supervisory Board of the Bank consists of three eminent Shari\u2019a scholars: Sheikh Esam Al Enzi, Dr. Ahmad Al Ayadi and Dr. Khalid Al Siyabi from Oman and other GCC counties to steer the Islamic Banking operations in the right direction. Al Yusr operations, according to the requirements stated in the IBRF, will have separate core-banking system, separate dedicated branches, and key staff positions to ensure no-commingling of conventional and Islamic funds, segregation of core functions and marketing of Islamic Banking products and services. The Bank has also separately allocated its capital for offering Islamic banking services and products. The Bank has planned to commence its Islamic operations with five (05) separate and dedicated Islamic Banking branches across Oman. The initial branches will be strategically located in major cities of the Sultanate i.e. Muscat, Salalah, Sohar, Nizwa, and Ibra.Al Yusr aspires to provide its customers with Shari\u2019a compliant innovative products and excellent customer services through state of art distribution channels at competitive prices.

Sharia prohibits the fixed or floating payment or acceptance of specific interest or fees (known as Riba or usury) for loans of money.
