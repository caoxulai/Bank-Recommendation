Buying your travel insurance policy from an aggregator gives you a full slate of options, so you know that you are getting the right policy for you. We make the process of connecting you with an appropriate plan that fits your needs quickly, easily, and above all, comprehensibly.\n\nNo one has as much experience as us when it comes to travel insurance. Those who have any industry experience tend to be general, closed market providers who have less of an incentive to care for you after the point of sale, while we are here 24\/7 when you have specific questions regarding a policy or any issues with your claim. All policies purchased through G1G come with 24\/7 emergency assistance so you are never left alone during a crisis abroad. Our knowledgeable staff has decades of industry experience and is here to guide you through purchasing a policy, navigating the customer portal, renewing your policy, filing and collecting on claims, finding nearby doctors and medical facilities, and accessing policy details and emergency assistance numbers.\n\nWe deliver a platter of policies curated just for you that we have carefully vetted and tested to meet our rigorous standards. G1G set an industry standard over a decade ago by requiring all providers to have an A.M. Best rating of no lower than an A. Building on that foundation, we have since elevated our quality assurance to include an analysis of a company's BBB report, customer reviews, claims pay-out ratio, reinsurers credit history, and other benchmarks that assist in connecting you with only the best products in the world. This often means making the decision of not offering products and underwriters that fall below our standard.\n\nOur industry experience combined with personal travel experience allows us to implement new ideas with the perspective of the user in mind. We are the only aggregator in the world to provide a fully branded client portal, giving you access to all your necessities in one place. We have made G1G.com accessible around the world \u2013 available through your personal computer, tablet, or phone, connecting you to real humans.\n\nAdditionally, we work with underwriters and third party administrators to create new products for travelers, and on a business-to-business level, allowing affiliates to resell our products and services to their users.

We have found a plan that offers private health insurance at first-rate medical care facilities in North America.\n\nDirect billing and prompt claims reimbursement is extremely important. Taking a lot of strain out of claims filing is the ability to pay claims directly to the provider.\nAs an expatriate you need to have the choice of where you want to receive medical care. The plans we feature provide you with complete choice of medical providers.\n\nAnd finally, if you plan to travel outside of your own country, be careful because most medical plans stop as you cross the border.
