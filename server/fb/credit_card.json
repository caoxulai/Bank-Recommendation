[{"ori_label":31,"name":"CreditCards.com","description":"CreditCards.com features an award-winning news team which reports news about credit cards, debit cards and other aspects of personal finance. The staff recently won a Society of American Business Editors and Writers award for its coverage of the Credit CARD Act of 2009. It also worked in conjunction with the White House on a video town hall discussion of the CARD Act. "},{"ori_label":31,"name":"Credit card","description":"A credit card is a payment card issued to users as a system of payment. It allows the cardholder to pay for goods and services based on the holder's promise to pay for them. The issuer of the card creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance.A credit card is different from a charge card: a charge card requires the balance to be paid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. A credit card also differs from a cash card, which can be used like currency by the owner of the card. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.The size of most credit cards is \u00d7 \u00a0in (85.60 \u00d7 53.98\u00a0mm), conforming to the ISO\/IEC 7810 ID-1 standard. Credit cards have a printed or embossed bank card number complying with the ISO\/IEC 7812 numbering standard. Both of these standards are maintained and further developed by ISO\/IEC JTC 1\/SC 17\/WG 1. Before magnetic stripe readers came into widespread use, plastic credit cards issued by many department stores were produced on stock (\"Princess\" or \"CR-50\") slightly longer and narrower than 7810. Some modern credit cards have a computer chip embedded in them for security reasons."},{"ori_label":31,"name":"Bangkok Bank Credit Card","description":"Our Credit Cards Giving you the spending power you want.\nGet purchasing power when you need it with a Bangkok Bank Credit Card.

It allows its holder to buy goods and services based on the holder's promise to pay for these goods and services. The issuer of the card creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the consumer (or the user) from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance to the user.\n\nA credit card is different from a charge card: a charge card requires the balance to be paid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. A credit card also differs from a cash card, which can be used like currency by the owner of the card. Most credit cards are issued by banks or credit unions, and are the shape and size specified by the ISO\/IEC 7810 standard as ID-1. This is defined as 85.60 \u00d7 53.98 mm (33\/8 \u00d7 21\/8 in) in size."},{"ori_label":31,"name":"Credit card fraud","description":"Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for theft and fraud committed using or involving a payment card, such as a credit card or debit card, as a fraudulent source of funds in a transaction. The purpose may be to obtain goods without paying, or to obtain unauthorized funds from an account. Credit card fraud is also an adjunct to identity theft. According to the United States Federal Trade Commission, while identity theft had been holding steady for the last few years, it saw a 21 percent increase in 2008. However, credit card fraud, that crime which most people associate with ID theft, decreased as a percentage of all ID theft complaints for the sixth year in a row.Although incidence of credit card fraud is limited to about 0.1% of all card transactions, this has resulted in huge financial losses as the fraudulent transactions have been large value transactions. In 1999, out of 12 billion transactions made annually, approximately 10 million\u2014or one out of every 1200 transactions\u2014turned out to be fraudulent. Also, 0.04% (4 out of every 10,000) of all monthly active accounts were fraudulent. Even with tremendous volume and value increase in credit card transactions since then, these proportions have stayed the same or have decreased due to sophisticated fraud detection and prevention systems. Today's fraud detection systems are designed to prevent one twelfth of one percent of all transactions processed which still translates into billions of dollars in losses.In the decade to 2008, general credit card losses have been 7 basis points or lower (i.e. losses of $0.07 or less per $100 of transactions). In 2007, fraud in the United Kingdom was estimated at \u00a3535 million."},{"ori_label":31,"name":"Credit Cards","description":"Keeping on top of your credit cards and making sure you are getting the best available rates and interest free periods is important. \n\nComparison credit cards understand this and want to make sure that you have access to the leading UK credit card deals. \n\nUse the comparison tables to compare some of the best credit card deals side by side and apply online today."},{"ori_label":31,"name":"Barclays Credit Cards","description":"Enjoy a world of privileges, high credit limits, exclusive discounts and promotions with leading brands with your Barclays Gold Card.

The Times actually stated, \u201cThe Square is beautiful and dog-simple.\u201d First, the Square app must be downloaded on the particular technology being used, which is only available for download on these specific types: iPhones, iPod touches, iPads, and Androids. All that is left to do for the setup after the app has been downloaded, is you must sign up for and create an account and enter quite a bit of personal information. Once you are registered, Square sends you a free card reader, and then once you connect I it into the headphone jack of your device, it immediately can begin accepting payments. This type of system works over any Wi-Fi and or a cell phone data connection. Now for you, making money is easy. You choose an amount, and swipe away. For those people who run their own type of businesses and sell only a small number of items can also set up a virtual shelf with all of the items for sale. This makes it easy when taking payments, because all you need to do is choose which item someone is purchasing and then the Square automatically calculates a total. Once the buyer swipes their card, a receipt is prepared, which includes the charges, location, or the company\u2019s logo. The customer then must sign the receipt on the phone\u2019s screen using their own finger, and they also must choose to either have the receipt e-mailed to them or sent as a text message."},{"ori_label":31,"name":"Naija Credit Cards","description":"Welcome to www.NaijaCreditcards.com.

It was established by a consortium of banks in the UK to rival the already established Barclaycard. It became defunct in 1996 when it was taken over by Mastercard.HistoryThe Access card was originally introduced in the United Kingdom on 23 October 1972 by a consortium of National Westminster Bank, Midland Bank, Lloyds Bank and Williams & Glyn's Bank, as a rival to the established Barclaycard. It was also issued in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland by Ulster Bank, a subsidiary of NatWest, Northern Bank, then a subsidiary of Midland; and Bank of Ireland, which was otherwise unconnected to the founder banks.The card scheme was run from several offices in Southend-on-Sea in Essex, England, by the Joint Credit Card Company with the main site being located at Priory Crescent, the former home of Ekco. It participated in the Eurocard\/MasterCard systems. Europay International has since been taken over by MasterCard International."},{"ori_label":31,"name":"US Prepaid \/ Debit \/ Credit Card \/ Bank Account Online for Non US Residents","description":"USA Prepaid \/ Debit \/ Credit Card \/ Bank Account Online for Non US Residents\nNo Social Security Number \/ No US Address\nFree Prepaid Card \/ Get $25 when you sign up"},{"ori_label":31,"name":"Valid Credit Cards","description":"The easiest way to buy online and to register in any website to become a member of the site.\n\nENTER INTO ANY WEBSITE THAT REQUIRES CREDIT CARD TO  BECOME A MEMBER using our new Credit Cards Purchase System (CCPS)\n   \n    We provide Valid Credit Cards for people buying online.\n We also help you to Register into any website of your choice that requires a Credit card form of payment.\n\nPart-payment is allowed for online website registration until the transaction is completed and verified by the customer.\n\ncontact us now!!\neasycc2buy@hotmail.com"},{"ori_label":31,"name":"Credit Card Processing","description":"Valued Merchant Services is a nationwide provider of all forms of electronic payment processing services for all types of business including retail businesses, restaurants, web based businesses, service providers, wholesalers and distributors, home based businesses, mobile businesses, transportation businesses and start up businesses.

Card issuers refer to the leading six digits on the card as an \"issuer identification number (IIN)\", or \"bank identification number (BIN)\". On rare occasions they are referred to as Bank card numbers. The remaining numbers on the card are referred to as the primary account number or PAN. IINs and PANS have a certain level of internal structure and share a common numbering scheme. Bank card numbers are allocated in accordance with ISO\/IEC 7812. This technical standard has two parts - Part 1 identifies the structure of the Issuer Identification Number. Part 2 identifies the application procedures and eligibility requirements for obtaining an IIN. The bank card number (or as it is commonly known - the IIN) identifies the issuer of the card, which is then electronically associated by the issuing organization with one of its customers and then to the customer's designated bank accounts. In the case of stored-value type cards, there is no necessary association with a particular customer.ISO\/IEC 7812 IINs are 6 digits in length, and can be up to 19 digits. The structure is as follows:  a six-digit Issuer Identification Number (IIN), the first digit of which is the Major Industry Identifier (MII), a variable length (up to 12 digits) individual account identifier, a single check digit calculated using the Luhn algorithm. The bank card number differs from the Bank Identifier Code (BIC\/ISO 9362, a normalized code - also known as Business Identifier Code, Bank International Code and SWIFT code). It also differs from Universal Payment Identification Code, another identifier for a bank account in the United States."},{"ori_label":31,"name":"Dah Sing ONE+ Credit Card","description":"\u5927\u65b0ONE+\u4fe1\u7528\u5361\u6fc0\u65b0\u767b\u5834\uff01\u7368\u4eab\u6fc0\u65b0\u300c\u4e00\u4eab\u4e00\u8cde\u300d\u6d88\u8cbb\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002ONE+\u5168\u5929\u50191%\u73fe\u91d1\u56de\u8d08\uff0c\u6bcb\u9808\u767b\u8a18\u7121\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u672c\u5730\u6216\u6d77\u5916\u5546\u6236\u4e4b\u96f6\u552e\u7c3d\u8cec\u6216\u73fe\u91d1\u900f\u652f\uff0c\u56de\u8d08\u91d1\u984d\u4e0d\u8a2d\u4e0a\u9650\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0cONE+\u624b\u6a5f\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff0c\u512a\u60e0\u96a8\u8eab\uff0c\u81f3\u6fc0\u767c\u653e\uff0c\u8d85\u904e1,000\u500bONE+\u5546\u6236\u71b1\u9ede\uff01ONE+\u5546\u6236\u71b1\u9ede\u8a2d\u6709\u6a19\u8a18\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u96a8\u6642\u96a8\u5730\u63d0\u4f9b\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u512a\u60e0\uff01\u7533\u8acbONE+\u99966\u671f9.8%\u7279\u60e0\u5e74\u606f\uff0c\u96f6\u552e\u7c3d\u8cec\u4eab\u99966\u671f9.8%\u7279\u60e0\u5e74\u606f\uff01ONE+ \u96fb\u5b50\u9322\u5305\u4ffe\u4f60\u66f4\u65b9\u4fbf\u4ed8\u6b3e\u9ad4\u9a57\uff0c\u6703\u5c07\u65bc\u5e74\u4e2d\u63a8\u51fa\uff0c\u5bc6\u5207\u7559\u610f\uff01\u6709\u95dc\u689d\u6b3e\u53ca\u7d30\u5247\uff0c\u8acb\u700f\u89bd\uff1ahttp:\/\/www.dahsing.com\/card\/ONE+"},{"ori_label":31,"name":"CreditCardNinja.com","description":"CreditCardNinja.com is dedicated to helping people understand debt & credit.

Wriston, the card followed the bank's purchase of an interest in the Carte Blanche charge card. However, the card proved to be limited by its regional scope, as it was tied to the area surrounding the bank's New York base of operations.In 1969, the card was absorbed into Master Charge (now known as MasterCard), another card that had been developed by a membership association of four banks, the Interbank Card Association, which National City Bank joined.Citibank, as First National City Bank came to be known in 1976, made a further attempt in 1977 to create a proprietary credit card that was not tied to either Master Charge or Visa. The Choice card was, like the Everything Card, a regional credit card issued only by Citibank.

The contestant from Contestants' Row who bids closest to the price of a prize without going over wins the prize and has the chance to win additional prizes or cash in an onstage game. After the pricing game ends, a new contestant is selected for Contestants' Row and the process is repeated. Six pricing games are played on each hour-long episode; three games per episode were played during the half-hour format. With the exception of a single game from early in the show's history, only one contestant at a time is involved in a pricing game.A total of 107 pricing games have been played on the show, 75 of which are in the current rotation. On a typical hour-long episode, two games\u2014one in each half of the show\u2014will be played for a car, at most one game will be played for a cash prize and the other games will offer merchandise or trips. Usually, one of the six games will involve grocery products, while another will involve smaller prizes that can be used to win a larger prize package.On the 1994 syndicated version hosted by Doug Davidson, the rules of several games were modified and other aesthetic changes were made. Notably, the grocery products used in some games on the daytime version were replaced by small merchandise prizes, generally valued less than $100. Episodes of The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular that aired in 2008 and both Big Money Week and Dream Car Week featured rule changes to some pricing games.

MUST Shop Around For The BEST Value & Benefits:\r\n\r\nValues & Benefits can vary greatly: And in some cases, credit cards might seem like great deals until you read the fine print and disclosures. When you\u2019re trying to find the credit card that\u2019s right for you, look at the:\r\n\r\nAnnual fees: Many issuers charge annual membership or participation fees. Some card issuers assess the fee in monthly installments.\r\n\r\nAnnual percentage rate (APR): The APR is a measure of the cost of credit, expressed as a yearly interest rate. It must be disclosed before your account can be activated, and it must appear on your account statements. The card issuer also must disclose the \u201cperiodic rate\u201d  the rate applied to your outstanding balance to figure the finance charge for each billing period. \r\n\r\nBalance calculation methods: You should understand that credit cards companies use three main balance calculation methods: average daily balance, previous balance, and adjusted balance. The most commonly used method of calculating your balance is the average daily balance. This method adds up your average daily balances for each day during the month, divides the total by the number of days in the month, and multiplies the result by your monthly interest rate (your APR divided by twelve).\r\n\r\nCash advances: Avoid using cash advances? Cash advances are an extremely expensive way to borrow money. Interest begins to accrue as soon as you get a cash advance, because cash advances are not considered normal credit card charges generally, the interest rate charged on cash advances is higher than the interest rate charged on purchases. In addition, there is usually a cash advance fee of between 1.5  and  5  percent of the cash amount advanced.\r\n\r\nCompounding period: The compounding period is how often interest is charged to your account. Most credit card company compound interest daily. It\u2019s interesting to note that when you save money, interest is compounded monthly, but when you borrow money interest is compounded daily. Any time you borrow money, remember that you are paying interest, not earning it.\r\n\r\nGrace period: The grace period is the number of days you have to pay your billing full without triggering a finance charge. For example, the credit card company may say that you have 25 days from the statement date, provided you paid your previous balance in full by the due date. Cards Issuers Companies grace periods may Vary.\r\n\r\nInterest rate: Credit card companies state the interest rate as an annual percentage rate, or APR. This is the true, simple, interest rate that is charged over the life of the loan. However, the APR does not take into account compounding periods or the time value of money.\r\n\r\nTransaction fees and other charges: Some issuers charge a fee if you use the card to get a cash advance, make a late payment, or exceed your credit limit. Some charge a monthly fee if you use the card or if you don\u2019t.\r\n\r\n*\u201dRead the Card\u2019s Terms & Conditions\u201d*"},{"ori_label":31,"name":"Accept Credit Cards at your Business","description":"Free retail, online, smart phone or wireless point of sale credit card processing equipment with merchant account services.

Debt accumulates and increases via interest and penalties when the consumer does not pay the company for the money he or she has spent.The results of not paying this debt on time are that the company will charge a late payment penalty (generally in the US from $10 to $40) and report the late payment to credit rating agencies. Being late on a payment is sometimes referred to as being in \"default\". The late payment penalty itself increases the amount of debt the consumer has.When a consumer has been late on a payment, it is possible that other creditors, even creditors the consumer was not late in paying, may increase the interest rates the consumer is paying. This practice is called universal default.Research shows that people with credit card debt are more likely to forgo needed medical care than others, and the likelihood of forgone medical care increases with the magnitude of credit card debt.StatisticsQuarterly Credit Card Debt in the United States Since 2010 :  Q2 2012: $798.5 Q1 2012: $790.3 Q4 2011: $834.4 Q3 2011: $799.5 Q2 2011: $794.3 Q1 2011: $786.0 Q4 2010: $833.1 Q3 2010: $819.2 Q2 2010: $830.5 Q1 2010: $843.1 Credit Card debt in other countries:  United Kingdom \u00a364.7 billion Australia $50 billion  Declines in credit card debt are often misinterpreted because they fail to include information about charge-offs. The possible causes for a decline in credit card debt are consumers paying down their debt, credit card companies writing charged-off debt off their books, or a combination of the two. Inclusion of charged-off debt can therefore significantly impact debt trends and the characterization of a nation\u2019s financial health. For example, the $10.3 billion decrease in outstanding credit card debt in Q3 2010 relative to the previous quarter might at first glance seem to be a significant consumer pay down. However, considering that the Q3 credit card charge-off rate was $16.9 billion, consumers actually increased their overall debt by $6.6 billion during this quarter."},{"ori_label":31,"name":"Credit Card Debt Solution","description":"Kenapa perlu membayar lebih kepada pihak bank??.Hentikan membayar 18% p.a Faedah kredit!\nAdakah anda ingin masih mahu meneruskan membayar kaedah kad kredit 18% setahun,bertahun-tahun?\nAnda tidak mempunyai tunai yang mencukupi dan tidak mampu untuk menyelesaikan baki kad kredit yang belum dibayar dalam waktu terdekat?? ------> Runsing dan sesak nafas.\nMaka solusinya sekarang anda mempunyai pilihan untuk berhenti membayar kadar faedah yang tinggi aitu 18% setahun dengan penyusunan semula(restructure) atau menukar semua baki kad kredit terkumpul ke dalam Pelan Pembayaran Mudah(EPP).\n\n\nStop paying 18% p.a for your Credit Card Interest!Why paymore to the bank????\nDo you still continue paying 18% p.a credit card interest rate years after years?\nYou do not have sufficient cash on hand and not able to settle all your credit card outstanding balance in near future?\nThe good news is you have an option to stop paying these unnecessary interest of 18% p.a by restructuring all your credit card outstanding balance into our Easy Payment Plan(EPP).\n\n\n\n "},{"ori_label":31,"name":"Credit Card Roulette","description":"1.
