A little over a month ago a nice family saved me from a very abusive home where I was choked multiple times and kicked in the throat and face also, I weigh 2 lbs.  The family nursed the wounds they could see, my eyes were especially bad, they were swollen shut.  But I couldn't eat for the family and they got very scared and found a rescue to help them.  My food would only go down a tiny bit and then it would come out my nose and mouth, mixed with a lot of sticky slobber and the choking was horrible, I was so hungry.  This is how I ended up where I am today. \n\n I was very sick and very skinny in the beginning and no one thought I would live, even the first vet I went to with the rescue lady said there was was little to no hope.   Oh my, the rescue lady is stubborn and she said she would not quit until I quit!!  I was very tired and laid very still at the vets office, I was so weak and skinny that most people didn't see me laying on the rescue lady's lap.  But when rescue lady got to McDonalds I perked up and said hi to everyone, it sure smelled good there, I was so hungry.  \n\n On the way home from the vet the rescue lady, who is now rescue mom Mary, gave me some whipped cream smeared very light on the lid of her coffee and I licked it and didn't choke at all!  This gave Mom Mary the idea that maybe there was a way to help me, just small amounts so I couldn't choke.  I kept hearing the rescue lady talk about when I got healthy enough we could go see a vet that specialized in very hurt and sick puppies, like me.  I began getting better and the family that saved me originally offered to foster me for a while and I did good for a few days, but on the 5th day I got very sick and everyone, once again,  thought I was going to die, I was so sick that I thought I was going to die too.  \n\nI am now back with the rescue lady and have been for 10 days, it has been hard, I have choked more than before and I have had a couple very scary times.  But I am getting better!!  I want to be alive and play like normal puppies play.  \n\n I went to the special vet yesterday in a big city (mom got lost, like usual I heard her say) and they said that I am still a little too sick for surgery but hopefully next week I will be good enough, since everyday I am drinking more and feeling better.  It is going to cost a lot try to get me better!!  But rescue Mom does think I am worth it and so does everyone else that meets me!!  \n\nThe special vet says my throat has a stricture, most likely caused from eating something that burnt my throat or getting something sharp caught in my throat, since I can't talk I can't tell anyone what really did happen.  The special vet says that they will do a surgery that blows the closed part up and they will put a tube in my side for mom Mary to feed me.......  It all sounds scary, but I am strong and I am excited to be a real puppy.  The special vet said I may need to have my throat blown up 3 more times and each time it is a surgery.  So here I am, I am trying to get better for surgery, I am anemic and we are working on that......  I am also asking for help with my surgery, in the end it will be between $3000 and $4000 dollars.  I know that's a lot, but the alternative is not acceptable.  If you would like to help me you can email my rescue mom, Mary, @ forsacredhearts@gmail.com or you can donate money through paypal with that same email.  Please tell Rescue Mom it is for Zita <3  Thank you!!!

They face a nearly impossible battle against the Chinese, the Taliban, and local politics to save their culture and heritage from permanent erasure.\n\nFor the past three years, the effort of director Brent E. Huffman through Saving Mes Aynak has played a vital role in delaying the demolition of this historical treasure, but again time is quickly running out. The Chinese State-owned mining company still has immediate plans to destroy Mes Aynak, and it could happen AT ANY MOMENT.  Now, the only way for Mes Aynak to be saved is if the Afghan government intervenes, halts mining, and officially petitions to UNESCO to make Mes Aynak a World Heritage Site. Only the Afghan government can approach UNESCO. \n\nThrough our film Saving Mes Aynak, our major goal is to raise mass awareness of the impending demolition, creating an international movement to put pressure on the mining company, the Afghanistan government, and UNESCO to make Mes Aynak a World Heritage Site.\nThis is the ONLY WAY to #SAVEMESAYNAK.\n\nThe more funds we raise, the more people will see the film and know the beauty and importance of Mes Aynak, and the greater the chance of Mes Aynak being saved. To do this, the focal point of our campaign is #SaveMesAynak Day on July 1st, a global event where supporters everywhere will stream the film and stand in unity together to save Mes Aynak. Through social media, we plan to use this day to spark worldwide protest, conversation, and action. After that, we will mount an ambitious outreach effort through our film to reach as many people as we can. The more awareness we can raise, the larger the pressure we can put on the Afghan government to stop the demolition, and to formally petition UNESCO. This way, we can ensure Mes Aynak's safety for future generations. \n\nLet's work together, and make history by saving history.

It has survived the ravages of weather and neglect on the back lot of the Selznick (later Desilu) Studios, the dismantling and shipping to Georgia where it has been loaded and reloaded by governmental and private groups seeking to build a permanent home, to its current resting place not far from the kitchen of the lady who sought it, bought it and protected it throughout her life.\n\nDue to a long relationship with the owners and his connection to \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d thru his internationally known tours, Peter Bonner has come with his film crew, his experts and his willing volunteers to \u201cpowder her nose\u201d and put the fa\u00e7ade on camera once again.\n\nPeter plans to tell the story of her survival, film her restoration and provide a way for her fans all over the world to come and visit her in time for her 75th birthday in 2014.\n\nWatch Peter Bonner Explain How He is \u201cSaving Tara\u201d:\n\nhttps:\/\/vimeo.com\/71863639\n\nPeter Bonner Historical And Hysterical Tours \u00a9TM\n\nPeter Bonner is an historian, public speaker and author renowned for his intimate knowledge of all things \u201cGone With The Wind\u201d and Margaret Mitchell.

John Miller (Tom Hanks) and GIs in a landing craft making the June 6, 1944, approach to Omaha Beach to face devastating German artillery fire. This mass slaughter of American soldiers is depicted in a compelling, unforgettable 24-minute sequence. Miller's men slowly move forward to finally take a concrete pillbox. On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name \"Ryan\" stenciled on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), learning that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon), be located and brought back to the United States. Capt. Miller gets the assignment, and he chooses a translator, Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davis), skilled in language but not in combat, to join his squad of right-hand man Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), plus privates Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), cynical Reiben (Edward Burns) from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo (Vin Diesel), and religious Southerner Jackson (Barry Pepper), an ace sharpshooter who calls on the Lord while taking aim. Having previously experienced action in Italy and North Africa, the close-knit squad sets out through areas still thick with Nazis. After they lose one man in a skirmish at a bombed village, some in the group begin to question the logic of losing more lives to save a single soldier. The film's historical consultant is Stephen E. Ambrose, and the incident is based on a true occurance in Ambrose's 1994 bestseller D-Day: June 6, 1944.

She was a premature baby weighing 1.7kilos; she has to be born that way since she suffered meconium aspiration syndrome and severe pneumonia. As a result to that she was confined in the Neonatal ICU for a month and needed to be placed in the incubator to survived, she have stayed in the Hospital her first 1 month on Earth bearing all the pain of all kinds of injections, dextrose, blood transfusion and even had to undergo NGT (Nasogastrictube feeding)\/feeding thru tube for 2 weeks.

Abused and an ex-fighting dog, he had no chance of survival. He was property of the FCAC shelter in Rome, Georgia where the county has a ban on adopting out Pit Bulls, period. This twisted ideology is called BSL or Breed Specific Legislation, where a dog is not just a dog, but targeted with prejudice.  The statistics today are that very few pit bulls will make out of shelter alive.  Whilst we are not focused or capable to be a large volume, pit bull rescue, but a foundation, we still get involved in rescuing as many dogs as we can & also can link you to organizations that can help. \n\n \n\nIt is devastating to read news stories where people have been hurt by a dog. Often an abused, mistreated and mismanaged dog(s). This should not be happening,  especially if the right resources were in place. BSL has proven that it is not effective. All dogs can be potentially dangerous & of course, some can do more damage than others. We must respect the strength and ability of any dog, keeping them and the public safe and increase the consequences when people do not abide by the laws. \n\n \n\nPit Bulls are often extremely intelligent dogs that are classified into the category of working dogs. They are not a dog that you place in the backyard and ignore... they are a sensitive, very high energy dog with a lot of drive and a need for regular mental and physical stimulation.  Otherwise, problems can arise. With pent up frustration, often they will want to escape from their yard and this is when we hear about a problem stemming from it in the news. Pit Bulls are very loving dogs, they bond very closely with their owner.  A person once said to me that a pit bull is unique because it will look you straight in the eyes, deep into your soul and connect with you; whereas, most dogs will just want to be pet and scratched.  The public has been tainted by the news media that pours out sensationalisms like a pit bulls jaws can lock or they can ''snap'' at any minute... or reporting on a dog attack that didn't even involve a pit bull, but calling it a pit bull. Simply put, pit bulls are just dogs. No breed of dog  can lock its' jaws and no specific breed, \"can snap at any minute\"... There are good dogs and bad dogs in all the canine varieties. Sadly pit bulls are often owned by people that should not own them and want them for more of a status symbol, than being a member of their family.\n\n \n\nThe goal of the Foundation is Education, Advocacy and Resources : Education to help pet owners to create a deeper bond with their dogs, empowering them to become more responsible, keeping them and the public safe. Teaching the public about the misconceptions that have been bred by the media; helping to increase the number of adoptions in shelters by families that wouldn't normally consider adopting a pit bull ~ through education and advocacy. Lastly, RESOURCES through fund raising for local pit bull rescues that do the hands-on, hard work.  Any monies raised are strictly for the Foundation & its' work. We have an open book policy & want to assure people that any funds will be appropriately used. We believe we will never adopt our way out of this epidemic of over population, but rather through spay neuter programs, clinics and support.

Yes, this is the third time he has bitten an \"intruder\" - each time someone entered his home and property without permission. Isn't that what we want our dogs to do? The police officer did not have a search warrant, Kristine was in her own home in bed, and the there was no noise coming from the property when the officers showed up for a noise complaint from earlier that afternoon (listening to oldies on WHNN). I will add that I am usually in total support of our police officers as they have a tough job and I appreciate that they risk their lives for me every single day. I will also add that I feel that some dogs are vicious for whatever reason, and need to be put down for the safety of others. But this dog was in his own home and yard each time someone entered without permission. In the second case, Kristine even warned the person not to enter until she contained her dog, and he said \"don't worry - all dogs love me\" and then proceeded to call animal control once he got bit. None of the bites were considered serious\n\nKristine is a responsible pet owner. Her yard is fenced. All of her dogs are utd on shots and spayed \/ neutered \/ licensed.

She just battled through a bone marrow transplant where we did not have a matching donor however had a cord blood that was close enough to go through the transplant. Five months after the transplant she relapsed once again and now we need to look at going to the US for treatment that is not offered in Canada in order to save her life. The treatment cost is from $500,000 - $800,000 USD which is why are fund raising. We have been researching whatever options we could find including a clinical trial which injects fighter cells to try and attack the leukemia cells and just found out that we also have at least a two month wait to get into the trial. We are praying for a miracle and hope she is eligible for a program such as this. \n\nAnya is a smart, intelligent, giving little girl that just wants to have fun and bring joy to others. To give you an idea of her demeanour, when Santa Clause came to see her at Sick Kids Hospital in Toronto during her bone marrow transplant and asked her what she wanted for Christmas, she replied with \"Presents for all of the sick kids here in the hospital\". Her braveness is unbelievable and really is an inspiring little girl to a lot of people. I would say the strongest people in my family are certainly my daughter at a hard number one, followed by my wife at a close second, then myself and my four year old boy at distant third and fourth. We are looking to raise money only to give her the best chance to live and any extra will be put right back into supporting someone or people who need it in similar situations to us. Another great example of my daughters mindset is, just before the recent relapse I went to South Africa for work and just as I was departing for the airport she ran to the door with her piggy bank asking me to give the money she had saved to the people who need it most in South Africa. I made sure to help someone there and captured some pics so Anya could see how she helped someone on the other side of the world. Her kind heart deserves a chance at life where she doesn't have to live in pain or in hospitals as since 2 1\/2 years old she has been fighting harder than most. \n\nWe appreciate any and all help and are committed to continue the fight of giving back. We are just battling something at the moment and if we can save my daughters life we can concentrate on continuing to give back and help others who need it as well. Thank you so much and I can assure you we are doing everything we can to give my daughter a real chance to get better. I am certain she is destined to be somebody great! \n\nThank you, \n\nMartinez family.","id":"463178423817516"},{"name":"Save Ferris","description":"Ska-Pop-Punk-Swing\n\n\n","id":"336327683137299"},{"name":"Saving Stimpy","description":"One of the best cover bands in Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky, and Southeast Indiana covering tunes from the 80's, 90's and today's music.

I was terrified of people and ran. My days were spent sleeping\/hiding behind the coke machines and store displays and my nights were spent hunting for food. Some people would leave food for me, others would throw things at me or try to run over me with their cars and buggies! I visited the McDonalds some and ate out of trash cans. I ended up having 3 little babies when I was just a baby myself, but someone took them when they were only 3 weeks old ! We have now found out that my 3 little boys were saved by an employee at the grocery store.  After numerous attempts to trap me, a lady ( Mommy) caught me and took me to Galleria Animal Clinic with the help of Have a Heart Animal Rescue and Adoption. They were wonderful ! I was spayed, vetted and chipped. I was then taken to a beautiful horse farm to live. The farm horses scared me and I was not happy.

During my time with the BWMHC I was very actively involved serving on several committees and enjoyed every minute of it. I was the newsletter editor for 8 years (2004-2011). I also served on the board of directors as treasurer for 4 years (2008-2011). From 2007-2010 the club's fun shows were held at my farm...these are some of my greatest memories, spending time with amazing friends both old and new and our wonderful little horses.\n\nIn 2009 I became involved with Chance's Miniature Horse Rescue (CMHR), first as a member then as a director at large. I became a foster home for this nationwide rescue in 2010 and since then I have fostered several horses. In May of 2010 I was asked to be treasurer for the rescue and I gladly accepted. As my passion for rescue grew I decided to make some changes and devote more of myself to making a difference in the lives of these little horses. So in December of 2011 I resigned my positions of treasurer and newsletter editor with the BWMHC to follow my heart which has led me on a amazing journey. I believe my time with both the BWMHC and CMHR along with the encouragement and support of my wonderful family and friends has prepared me to follow another dream....opening my own rescue!\n\n On September 17, 2014, Saving Grace Miniature Horse Rescue went from a dream I never thought possible to a reality!

I hope to study and document the damage caused to the wreck, look at alternative mooring options and try to get these implemented as soon as possible to help save the wreck.\n\nWhat we hope to achieve\nI would like to raise awareness of the damage caused to Thistlegorm through improper mooring, initially start by trying to educate dive companies that moor on the wreck.  I also want to look into mooring options available to allow boats to moor next to the wreck and not actually on the wreck.  Once these have been researched I would like to raise funds to get these put into place and in use as soon as possible.\n\nOther possibilities\nIt could be possible to film for TV the current damage and document the improper moorings, then covering the research into other similar cases (if any) where moorings have been successfully introduced and apply these to the Thistlegorm.  The fundraising etc can be filmed and then the application of these moorings and a revisit to the site to see them in use as a conclusion.\n","id":"953582378003506"},{"name":"SavingsMania","id":"95580846136"},{"name":"Save-A-Lot food stores","description":"Save-A-Lot is one of the nation\u2019s leading extreme value, carefully selected assortment grocers.

While writing his doctoral thesis on the history of the credit union movement at New York University, Bill was advised by his close friend Thomas \"Cork\" Corcoran to put his education to use and start a credit union himself. Bill and Kay first approached fellow teachers and offered free membership to school employees throughout Hudson County.\n \n Starting out with no paid staff and just 68 members signing up for payroll deduction, the credit union grew slowly at first. At the end of 1952, the credit union had 251 members and held $39,192 is assets. Bill and Kay ran the small institution out of their home on Columbia Avenue, taking deposits and making loans across the kitchen table.\n \nAs the credit union grew stronger, more groups looked for our services to be provided for their employees.  In 1977 our name changed to Educational Federal Credit Union.  In the late 1970's and early 1980's, several smaller credit unions joined forces with Educational FCU and a result of the mergers, our credit union grew tremendously.\n \n As we began to acquire Select Employee Groups outside of the education industry, our board and management felt that Educational FCU did not adequately reflect our expanding base of membership; therefore, in 1986, we changed our name to Liberty Savings Federal Credit Union.\n\nIn addition to the almost 200 Select Employee Groups that we currently serve throughout northern NJ, we can also offer membership to anyone who lives, works, worships, or attends school anywhere in Hudson County. \n \nToday LSFCU boasts over $50 million in assets and we have over 16,000 members.

On Jan. 3, 1966, he and one other employee greeted their very first customer ten minutes after the door opened.\nFirst Federal was founded to fulfill a public need. \n\nProviding quality customer service has been First Federal\u2019s focus from the beginning. \u201cIt has been said that to survive as a small community bank today, one must have a niche in the market,\u201d Dick said. \u201cMortgage banking is and has been the niche that has worked well for us.\u201d Customers could expect personalized service from the start. \n\nYear after year, serving the community is the focus and purpose of First Ferderal. In Rochester, First Federal hosted four free concerts by the Purdue University Varsity Glee Club over the years. In addition, Dick\u2019s weekly half-hour radio show on local station WROI, WROIFM.com, features guest speakers, announcements of local events and sports, as well as bank news\n.\nDick often refers to the staff as the \u201cFirst Federal Family\u201d, and the relaxed working atmosphere is behind First Federal\u2019s success. \n  \n\u201cOur staff through the years has helped make First Federal the fine bank it is today,\u201d Dick said. \u201cOur mission statement says it very well: First Federal\u2019s mission is to serve our customers with the newest, competitively priced products delivered to them with state-of-the-art technology; to provide to all First Federal Family members a favorable working environment with reasonable compensation and benefits; and to treat all customers and First Federal Family members in the manner that all would like to be treated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the biggest bank,\u201d he said, \u201cjust the best.\u201d\n","id":"882340178474909"},{"name":"Saving Humanity","id":"260507377426198"},{"name":"Saving Common Cents","description":"Ideas and suggestions for those looking to enjoy health, happiness, love, family, friends, and the planet to the fullest and on a budget.","id":"170201963037835"},{"name":"Saving Suffering Strays - Sarajevo","description":"SHORT VIDEOS ABOUT MILENA'S LIFESAVING WORK:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KOux43MfUhQ\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EB8Shnw_AN8\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PBo_U0ZAQeY&feature=em-upload_owner#action=share\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EyzHJ7k_0qY&feature=share\n\nENGLISH LANGUAGE FACEBOOK PAGE:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Saving-Suffering-Strays-Sarajevo\/108269329313209\n\nENGLISH LANGUAGE ADOPTIONS FACEBOOK PAGE:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Saving-Suffering-Strays-Adoption-Page\/297472987059163?fref=ts\n\nCANADIAN FACEBOOK PAGE:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/canadiansforssss?fref=ts\n\nGERMAN FACEBOOK PAGE:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Rettung-leidender-Stra\u00dfenhunde-Sarajevo\/1546269868991972\n\nSWEDISH FACEBOOK PAGE:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Saving-Suffering-Strays-Sarajevos-svenska-sida\/1400012463553843\n\nFINNISH FACEBOOK PAGE:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SavingSufferingStraysSarajevoFinland\n\nPORTUGUESE FACEBOOK PAGE:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SavingSufferingStraysSarajevoPaginaPortuguesa\n\nITALIAN FACEBOOK PAGE (to be republished shortly):\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Saving-Suffering-Strays-Sarajevo-pagina-italiana\/302609036522482?fref=ts\n\nITALIAN ADOPTIONS FACEBOOK PAGE (to be republished shortly):\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/savingsufferingstrayssarajevopaginaadozioni?fref=ts\n\nTWITTER PAGE:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/StraysSarajevo\n\nMilena Malesevic's personal facebook page: \n\nhttp:\/\/www.facebook.com\/milena.malesevic.52?ref=ts\n\nFACEBOOK GROUP:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/SSSarajevo\/","id":"108269329313209"},{"name":"SavingsInSeconds","description":"Saving your \u00a2ents in seconds!

Cut-off ranges vary between 1 in 150 (a 0.7% chance) and 1 in 300 (a 0.3% chance).  \n\nAround 1 in 20 (5%) of pregnant women will have an increased chance result at a 1:300 cut-off. The natural live birth rate of Down syndrome is around 1 in 500 pregnancies (0.2%).\n\nFor some parents, screening can be helpful to prepare for the birth of their child. \n\nSome parents choose to not use screening at all due to the possibility of anxiety and stress associated with the process. \n\nSaving Downs advocates that screening should be optional as an informed choice and not be considered an element of routine pregnancy care. \n\nDiagnostic tests\n\nAn invasive diagnostic test is required to determine whether Down syndrome is present in a pregnancy following an increased chance result from prenatal screening. \n\nFor every 200 woman who have an invasive diagnostic test, one or two will have a miscarriage as a result of the test. The tests can also cause other harm to the child. Statistically, the risk of harm exceeds the medical benefits to the child that rely on a confirmed pre-birth diagnosis. \n\nFor some parents diagnostic tests can be a valuable information tool to prepare for the birth of their child. \n\nSome women choose to not have diagnostic tests due to the risk of harm to their pregnancies. \n\nSaving Downs advocates that parents must be fully informed as to the risks of diagnostic testing.\n\nSaving Downs advocates that diagnostic tests must respect the life and integrity of the unborn child, cause no harm, be only directed towards safeguarding or healing the unborn child and be presented in a way that does not discriminate against people with Down syndrome.\n\nAdoption\n\nThere are many families who are interested in adopting a child with Down syndrome. Saving Downs can direct parents to relative support groups.\n\nPregnancy termination\n\nSaving Downs does not consider a diagnosis of Down syndrome to be a reason for terminating a pregnancy. Parents should continue to be fully supported through the pregnancy.\n\nContact us at savingdowns@gmail.com","id":"195879623802771"},{"name":"Saving Super Nova","description":"Nova was born 15 weeks too soon on 10.17.12 weighing only 1 lb 13 oz.

This page was created by volunteers to showcase animals held in high kill shelters with little to no exposure.   Our current focus is on the dogs held in Smith County\u2019s shelter in Tyler, TX.  The facility is not open to the public so there is no foot traffic to help with adoptions & rescues.  The shelter is currently under the operation of the Fire Marshal's Office as of 10\/1\/2014.  Smith County inmates are transported to the shelter every morning to clean and care for the dogs.  There is no permanent staff on site at the present time. \n\nBefore Saving Animals from Euthanasia in Texas was started in June 2013 it is estimated that approximately 99% of healthy and adoptable dogs entering the Smith County shelter were killed.  For 6 years this went on, under the radar and unchecked at the cost of approximately 8,000 dog\u2019s lives.  After only a few months with only a few volunteers and very few resources we have brought Smith County statistically to No Kill.  Today, more dogs are leaving Smith County Shelter alive than any other time in its history.  However, in order for this to continue the shelters themselves must step up and make the commitment to strive for No Kill.  The community must step up and demand nothing less from our municipal shelters, local shelters, animal welfare organizations and rescue groups.\n\nThe good news is that Smith County and Tyler can lead the way for our area in becoming a No Kill Community using the No Kill Equation: a philosophy which has been proven to work across the country to save more than 90% of shelter animals. There are currently more than 300 No Kill Communities across the country representing some 500 cities.  These communities are both urban and rural; they are wealthy and poor; they are liberal and conservative.  The one thing all of these communities have in common is a desire to save the lives of homeless animals while saving money in the process.  Many of the programs identified as key components of saving lives are more cost-effective than impounding, warehousing, and then killing animals as saving the lives of animals is revenue-positive in the community. \n\nWhat do these communities have that we don\u2019t have?  Nothing.  We are proud.  We are progressive.  We are smart and we are creative.  Let there be no doubt we can learn from other regions and find ways to save lives of the companion animals we love and value.\n\nFor more information:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/smithcountypetsalive \nhttp:\/\/www.smithcountypetsalive.org\/ \n","id":"1388603924690341"},{"name":"Saving Station Church","id":"905921066131935"},{"name":"Saving German Shepherds on Death Row","description":"To help attract rescue and possibly attract GSD rescues in the Midwest and East Coast who are looking to save these dogs...","id":"124662287717580"},{"name":"Save the Bats","description":"Bats are essential to the health of our ecosystem.

The film was selected as part of the 2013 Hong Kong International Film Festival.PlotIt is early Northern Song dynasty, AD 986, in Northeastern China. The film starts as Yang Ye (Adam Cheng), the leader of the Yang Clan and General for Song, executes 30 whiplashes to his youngest and second youngest child. They participated in a kung fu tournament which caused the death of a rival clan's son. The following morning, the two clan leaders meet with the emperor about the issue when the signaling stations (used for warning an oncoming invasion by their neighboring country) ignites.It was the Khitan army invading, hoping to take its revenge on Yang Clan for a past massacre that killed the former Khitan general. It was noted that the leader of the oncoming Khitan army is led by the son of the former Khitan general. Due to politics and the recent death of rival clan's son, the rival clan leader is awarded with 50,000 troops to welcome the Khitan army. As punishment, General Yang is awarded to lead the charge and be the scout for Song Dynasty. When the two armies meet, the lack of leadership by the rival clan leader causes chaos among the Song army as Khitan takes a decisive victory. All the while, General Yang is trapped behind enemy lines as the retreat horn sounds.The chaos causes General Yang Ye to be trapped in an abandoned town in front of Wolf Mountain, as the Khitan army surrounds the town, allowing no one to leave. Song's army, now led by the clan rival, refuses to help and rescue Yang Ye (assumed to be politics again among the clan rivals). This leaves Yang Ye's wife devestated as she sends her seven sons to rescue him. It is later revealed that this is exactly what the Khitan general wanted, and the seven sons fall into their deadly trap.","id":"179130925513237"},{"name":"Saving Kentucky Shelter Animals","description":"WHO WE ARE:\nSaving Kentucky Shelter Animals connects rescues\/adopters\/fosters with shelter animals in the state of Kentucky, to increase state-wide save rates.

Unfortunately she was not treated well and we can only speculate the horrible things that she has been through. She had a family, but they never treated her as such and allowed her to run at large and didn't care for her well. As a result she was picked up by the animal control officer and her family wouldn't even answer the door to let her back into their home, so she was taken to the local shelter. Due to something that happened to her in her past, she is terrified of other dogs and even goes to the extreme of hurting herself to escape to get away from them. AATA Rescue was contacted about this gorgeous girl and has been doing everything that they can to try to help her. As of early April, 2015 she is still in the shelter waiting for the legal time limit to be up to be released, at which time she will go into the loving care of the AATA family. AATA is working tirelessly to find the perfect home for Sweetie where she will be loved and can live comfortable and no longer in fear. Please love Sweetie along with us and follow her story to see her blossom like the flowers in spring.","id":"1621752168055485"},{"name":"Saving Paws Animal Rescue","id":"209108531376"},{"name":"Save Our Water","id":"68570165885"},{"name":"Saving Paws Animal Rescue of Kentucky","id":"114631026186"},{"name":"Saving Wild","description":"I write about wild animals and wild places  \n","id":"213337672018576"},{"name":"Savings Lifestyle","id":"117374314983503"},{"name":"Saving People Hunting Things The Family Business","id":"312201518970444"},{"name":"Saving Lives","description":"Saving Lives was created by a small group of animal advocates who share a mutual passion, love and respect for all animals alike, but especially our beloved Bully Breeds.\nWe are here only for the animals.

She was given four days to live. \n\nThe shocking and painful discovery came three days after birth. \n\nAccording to Gillian, in her own account of that painful journey, \u201cIt was not until 13th April, 2010 during \n\na routine examination of Aida, a heart murmur was discovered. She was kept at the hospital under \n\nobservation and was discharged the following day.\n\nWe thought that all was well. We were wrong,  approximately 3 weeks later Aida was readmitted to the \n\nhospital.  Things started to take a different turn. Aida was slowly losing her strength.  On June 2nd 2010 \n\nshe went into cardiac distress and was airlifted to a children\u2019s hospital in Martinique.  She was examined \n\nby a team of specialists, and was diagnosed with a cyanotic Congenital Heart disease (Severe Ebstein\u2019s \n\nAnomaly, Pulmonary Atresia).  The doctor told us there\u2019s no hope, that our little daughter would be \n\ndead within 4 days. His words were \u201cI know what I\u2019m saying, I wish there was something else I could say \n\nto you, she is not going to make it so you should move on with your lives together with your other \n\ndaughter (Akira Hope Dupigny).\u201d\n\nToday a small committee made up of Gillian\u2019s co-workers in the Nelson\u2019s Dockyard has been formed to \n\nmove this cause forward. \n\nOn Friday May 1, after a long and arduous search to find the institution that would best help Aida, \n\nGillian received a medical opinion and treatment options from the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. The BCH \n\nadvises that she would need US$187,687.00 for a combination of services to correct her abnormality.  \n\nThis does not include airfare to Boston, accommodation and subsistence while in Boston and airfare to \n\nBarbados for VISA purposes. This accounts for an additional US$10,394.80. \n\nA fund has been started at the Dockyard branch of Antiguan bank, ECAB, in the name of Aida\u2019s mother, \n\nGillian Dupigny.

He was cold, malnourished, had scars all over his head and neck and was  unable to walk. Mrs. Suzie and her daughter went to try and help, Cooper saw us and literally drug his little broken body to us wagging his tail the entire time:) He let us load him into the car and we headed to the Emergency Vet......not before stopping for some yummy people food on the way for him to fill up on. The 2 Vets at the Emergency Clinic told us he had nerve damage to his front left leg and multiple fractures to his rear left leg, they said it would be impossible to repair and he would not have any quality of life, our best option was to put him to sleep and end his suffering. We sincerely felt as if we had no choice and signed the papers to have him euthanized. My daughter and I had been joined by Chrissy Cheshire with Cheshire Abbey, a local animal rescue group and we all 3 cried while signing the papers to allow them to end his life. My daughter and I left, I was hyperventilating while my 15 year old daughter tried to tell me we were doing the right thing. I just could not imagine having to put him down, he literally snuggled and licked Tyler the whole way to the Vet and was so genuinely happy to have us there to help him. About an hour later I received a call from Chrissy, she had contacted other rescue groups who joined her at the Vet and after visiting with Cooper they decided he ad way to much personality to be put down, they found a video of another 2 legged dog named \"super fifty boy\" and he became our inspiration to try and save Cooper. Our hope is that Cooper will make a full recovery, we don't know if he will end up with 2 legs or 3, we are desperately trying for 3 but its not likely. We are hoping that once healed and rehabilitated, Cooper will be an inspiration to those who have lost a limb....... or two:) He has such an amazing personality  and is such a charmer he simply deserves a chance. His surgeries will not be cheap so we are hoping that anyone  that can might be willing to donate towards his care.   \n\nMonetary donations can be paid directly to \n\nHometown Veterinary Clinic\nDr. Kirby  601-825-1697 \n1010 MS-471\nBrandon, MS 39042\n\nand let them know its for Cooper's bill or monetary donations to the group who got the call about Cooper and made the decision he should live despite what the vets said \nCheshire Abbey\nPayPal- cheshireabbey@gmail.com\n\nor by sending a check to: \nCheshire Abbey\nPO Box 16330\nJackson, MS 39236\n\nOr find their donation link on their fb page\n\nPut for cooper in memo box\n\nI will try and update this page as often as possible, I am a little technically challenged so it will not be amazing but I will do my best:) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"419381601554223"},{"name":"Saving Face (2012 film)","description":"Saving Face is a 2012 documentary film directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and Daniel Junge about acid attacks on women in Pakistan. The film won an Emmy Award and the 2012 Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject), making its director, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, Pakistan's first Oscar winner.SynopsisSaving Face features two women attacked by acid and their struggle for justice and healing. It follows London-based Pakistani plastic surgeon Dr. Mohammad Jawad as he journeys to Pakistan to perform reconstructive surgery on survivors of acid violence. Saving Face broaches the subject of the under-reporting of acid violence against women due to cultural and structural inequalities towards women from Pakistani men. The Acid Survivors Foundation of Pakistan, which is featured in the film, had documented more than 100 acid attacks a year in Pakistan but estimates far more due to lack of reporting.Obaid-Chinoy has stated that the film is \"a positive story about Pakistan on two accounts: firstly, it portrays how a Pakistani-British doctor comes to treat them and it also discusses, in great depth, the parliament\u2019s decision to pass a bill on acid violence\". She has said that the film assisted in the trial and conviction of one of the perpetrators of acid violence.","id":"283226961757397"},{"name":"Saving Shiloh","description":"Saving Shiloh is a family movie produced in 2006, based on the book of the same name written by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. It is the third and final film in the trilogy, whose other members are Shiloh and Shiloh Season. The film is rated PG for some thematic elements and peril.PlotThe movie begins with Marty Preston explaining the events of Shiloh and Shiloh 2: Shiloh Season. Then Judd Travers shows up at the Preston home with dead squirrels as a present for Marty and his family for helping him after his truck accident in the second film. A fearful Shiloh runs into the kitchen since he is still scared of Judd. Marty's sister, Becky , embarrasses her mother, Louise , when she calls Judd the meanest man since Judd says he has eaten dead squirrels all his life. Soon, Marty hears from his two best friends, David Howard and Samantha Wallace , that after a fist fight, a drunken Judd has been charged with murder. Marty brings Judd some squirrel stew and offers to help Judd, believing that he hasn't committed murder. Soon after, when Marty is helping Judd build a fence for his hunting dogs, Judd accidentally steps on one of his dog's paws. The dog starts attacking Judd, biting his good leg. Judd doesn't show any fear, grabbing the dog and swinging him at a fence. Afterwards, when Dara Lynn , another of Marty's sisters, falls into a lake, Marty jumps in to save her. Shiloh jumps in to help but gets caught in the current, which leads toward Miller Falls. Marty goes back into the lake to save Shiloh but gets caught in a branch. Seeing this, Judd jumps off a cliff into the lake to free Marty. Marty explains to Judd that Shiloh is going to go over the waterfall unless he saves him. Judd saves Shiloh and begins a friendship with Marty and Shiloh. The film ends with Marty saying, \"If you open your heart, anything is possible.\"","id":"438652969530262"},{"name":"Save.ca","id":"122357111120284"},{"name":"Saving Grass","id":"716083225186821"},{"name":"Save a Dog","id":"343247239037823"},{"name":"Saving lives","id":"931441670202853"},{"name":"Saving Zeus","id":"1419239968381058"},{"name":"Saving Reggie","id":"333110916868142"},{"name":"Saving K9 Lives","description":"Join our CRUSADE: \"ADOPT from a Rescue, Don't SHOP from a Breeder!\"\nPromoting spay\/neuter your pet, because it is better to sterilize instead of euthanize!  \n\nCelebrities using their power to help DOGS IN NEED (of a home, love and families)","id":"133298600074982"},{"name":"Saving Chief","description":"Chief is a fun, charismatic, athletic, brindle Mastiff mix who was rescued from Yonkers Animal shelter. \nChief has joined ChaseK9 Services to help facilitate his adoption process by teaching him how to be the perfect well-mannered companion for his special furever home.

The band is known for its songs \"Girl Next Door\", \"Come Down To Me\" and \"SuperGirl\".History2002-2008: Girl Next Door, One Girl Revolution and SuperGirlWhat started out as simply a campfire song between strangers soon turned into a musical connection in the form of the Columbus, OH-based alternative pop\/rock group Saving Jane. It was at this bonfire that vocalist Marti Dodson (then a junior at Ohio State University) and rhythm guitarist Pat Buzzard first met and subsequently became friends. The pair began writing songs together and when the time came to record their work, local drummer Dak Goodman was recruited to help. The trio found something in each other, and the decision was made to form an actual band. Booking their first show, they took the name Saving Jane from a cartoon Dodson had been doodling one late night at the studio. As the band slowly began making a name for itself around Columbus, an additional lead guitarist, Kris Misevski, and a borrowed bass player from Goodman's cover band rounded out the group. About a year later, tensions within the band lead to the departure of their borrowed bassist, and Jeremy Martin replaced him in 2002. Two years later, as Saving Jane found their style shifting more from acoustic roots to alternative rock, their manager insisted that Dodson be emphasized over the rest of the band; these changes eventually led to the exit of their lead guitarist. In February 2006, Mike Unger stepped down from Saving Jane for family reasons, and Brandon Hagan joined the band as a replacement, while keyboardist Joe Cochran who completed the lineup, left in late 2006. Also as of 2008, Jeremy Martin is no longer with the band.

NS&I attracts savers through offering savings products with tax-free elements on some products, and a 100% guarantee from H.M. Treasury on all deposits.

The aim of the bank was to allow ordinary workers a facility \"to provide for themselves against adversity and ill-health\", and to provide the government with access to debt funding. As an example, savings certificates were issued in World Wars I and II to help finance the war effort. On 1 June 1957, the Premium Bonds draws were inaugurated, using E.R.N.I.E. \u2013 the Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment machine (now located in the Science Museum).In 1969, the bank was transferred from the Post Office to the Treasury.

In fact the American flag is flown to this day by the \"KKK\". That was their original flag and they still fly it today. Most people think the Confederate Flag is bad because it flew over slavery, However the same could be said about the American flag because it actually flew over slavery for seventy years before the Confederate States of America even became in existence, The Confederate Flag never flew over the ships that brought the slaves over to America. The Confederate States of America released all of their slaves in 1863, While the federal union didn't do it until 1868, With the passage of the 13th amendment. People call it the \"Rebel Flag\". To be perfectly honest it wasn't the south that rebelled it was the north under president Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln rebelled and over threw the government that was given to us (The Confederate States of America) in 1787. the south tried to maintain that government by succeeding from the Union and thus lead on until the Civil War.\n\n\n~ Dictated But Not Read, Kason Stanley and Jacob Proffitt","id":"1597322467199143"},{"name":"Saving Chinesecrested.no","description":"A group has been created to work on saving www.chinesecrested.no.

I would really like to help the NHS make all of these things happen because PEOPLE WANT THEM! I would like to hear from any endocrinologists \/ nurses or anyone else in the medical profession who is willing to listen to me and discuss peoples concerns without being defensive and viewing me as a busy body who is not wanted or needed (it seems like them and us at the moment) because their are clear issues and 1,356 people agree as do the 10,000 people who have signed my petition to develop the epipen i just want to help make this better so my child and other people like her can live a safe happy and healthy life ...... Thank you \n\nA copy and paste of the epi pen campaign\n To Develop a life saving pen injection for all steroid deficient children and adults\nWhy is this important?\n\nMy little girl who is 14  has been diagnosed with hypopituitarism, thus meaning her pituritary gland is not  working affecting many glands in her body. \nThe most serious being her adrenal gland, she is now cortisone dependent which means she needs to carry a life saving emergency injection everywhere she goes. Because this condition is quite rare there is not a quick pen injection like the epi pen or diabetes pen. This means that in a time of crisis a small glass bottle containing cortisone is snapped opened a syringe is drawn up with the medication, a sterile needle is taken out of the packet and then attached to the said syringe. This is then injected intramuscular in to the leg.\n I am very sure that my little girl in a close to unconscious state would not even be able to take the top off  the little glass tube let alone draw it in to a syringe and then inject it in to herself but this is  what she would HAVE to do to save her own life if she were alone. Im terrified to let her out of my sight. Even I worry that in this situation as a parent I would not be able to calmly do this. I know many other mothers and sufferers also feel this way, it seems that it is not viable  because there are very few people with this condition which gives the impression that their lives are not as important as those who suffer with diabetes or fatal allergy sufferers. \nUltimately I would like my little girl to finally have a normal life, she has suffered with very poor health for the past 14 years, she has gone through so much and come through so much I think now she deserves the right to a more  healthy life with the safe knowledge that no mistakes can be made in saving her life in an emergency situation. This injection pen could mean life or death to all of these people. \nPlease consider listening to my plea, I do not want to use my daughter in any publicity stunts or news stories to promote this campaign because she is going through \/ has been through enough. Hearing the story of how she could die any minute without an emergency injection is not something I want her to be continually listening to and I would never use her in this way. \nI know saying that will make this pettition even harder because no one wants to see a mother blabbing on about it, that does not get much sympathy or capture anyones imagination, I know they would rather see a cute little girl with a potentially life threatening condition telling her own story. I am not prepared to do this but will do anything personally in my own power to make it happen, everyone deserves the right to life. All other pettitions and campaigns have fallen on deaf ears. So please everyone get behind me and show your support. Ill quote in my daughters own words from when she was 3 suffering double pneumonia in hospital on Christmas Eve. \n'Mummy its not fair any more like this'\nPlease listen this time\nYours sincerely\nRachel Pegler.\n","id":"219120364922756"},{"name":"Saving Sierrabelle","description":"Sierra was rescued from the shelter by Sasha's Hope and Rescue on August 23, 2014. She had the worst case of mange the shelter had ever seen. She was emaciated, dehydrated, anemic, and near death.  I offered to emergency foster sweet Sierrabelle until she is healthy enough to be transported to her rescue or adopted. Here is a brief timeline of her first two weeks with me.   \n-Saturday August 23: I pick Sierra up from the shelter.\n-Sunday August 24: I take Sierra to Peachtree Corners Animal Clnic where she is evaluated and treated by an amazing staff. \n -Monday August 24: Sierra develops diarrhea. She had tested negative for parvo at the shelter, but was still vulnerable to the disease, so PCAC sent Sierra's angel vet tech Carly Landry out to my house to retest for parvo. Still negative.\n -Wednesday August 27: Sierra developed a very slight cough. \n -Thursday August 28: Sierra heads back to PCAC for severe cough and develops diarrhea in the vet office. Tests positive for coccidia (previously negative...has to do with the life cycle of the bug) and is diagnosed with upper respiratory infection. \n -Friday August 29: Sierra's breathing worsens and we decide to begin nebulizer treatments. Angel Carly Landry comes to the house with meds, and Sarah Couch Davis delivers me a nebulizer macine out of thin air.\n -Saturday August 30: Sierra meets her next Angel, Xena the Warrior Puppy's momma, who posts Sierra's story on her page and increases awareness and donations for Sierra. \n -Saturday August 30, PM: Sierra begins coughing up brown fluid and I take her to a 24 hour emergency clinic. Within 20 minutes of arriving, both Carly and Xena's mommy arrive to stay with me. Sierra is diagnosed with severe pneumonia and must be hospitalized. Brown fluid = pus and blood from her lungs.\n -Sunday August 31: I pick Sierra up from the 24 hour emergency vet and transport her back to PCAC for further evaluation. Sierra's next angel steps into her life when Dr. Jackson decides she will take Sierra home over the holiday weekend to monitor her closely and continue her on IV antibiotics and fluids.\n -Tuesday September 2: Sierra comes back to my home and seems to be recovering nicely.\n -Thursday September 4: Sierra develops yellow drainage from her nose and darker staining on her puppy pad and I transport back to PCAC for evaluation. She gets repeat chest xrays and medication modification.  \n-Friday September 5: Once again, Sierra seems to be resting nicely. She will go back in on Monday for repeat chest xrays and medication modification. She will stay on antibiotics for 4-6 weeks after radiographic resolution of her pneumonia. We had to take her off her meds for the coccidia because she is currently on eight different meds and her system cannot handle another at this time. She has come a long way in 14 days, but still has quite a long way to go.\n\nSome people may wonder why we spend so much money and time and effort into saving one very sick dog when that money and time can be used to save so many others.  You know why? Every Life Matters. \n\nYou can make a tax deductible donation help with Sierra's care through paypal: sashashopeandrescue@yahoo.com  \n\nYou can also donate directly through Sierra's GoFundMe page: http:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/dsnhs0\n\nIf you prefer snail mail like me, here is the mailing address: \nSasha's Hope and Rescue\n592 Calumet Loop\nJasper, Al 35501\n\nPlease note, by making a donation to Sasha's Hope and Rescue for Sierra you agree that if donations exceed Sierra's medical needs, the funds may be used at the rescue's discretion to continue their mission of rescuing other dogs like Sierra.  \n\n","id":"1398023223772448"},{"name":"Saving Sunday","description":"On Feb 22 sunday had a bad asthma attack which led to her heart stopping for about 10 mins.

It\u2019s been described as earnest, honest, and original\u2014the music of the people.\n\nSaving Damsels has been hailed as one of the best bands in Albuquerque and are guaranteed to be crowd pleasers. \n\nReservation Boy and Indian Girl, are two fan favorites. Songwriter, lead vocalist and rhythm guitar player J.J. Otero, explains the stories behind these songs:  \n\nReservation Boy\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid, I was always listening to the AM radio station that was broadcast all over the Navajo reservation. I would hear old country greats like Chet Atkins, Patsy Cline, Wil Rogers. It wasn\u2019t til years later that I realized that those great songs were coming from a place further back in music history. I heard Ralph Stanley, Ernest Tubbs, and Bill Monroe for the first time in my early 30\u2019s and absorbed as many songs and documentaries as I could find on that style of \u2018ol\u2019 timey music.\u2019\n\nAfter viewing a documentary on Ralph Stanley, I sat down and started writing a song with that bluegrass vibe. It\u2019s as though I could hear all the harmony and instrumentation parts right then and there. A few days later, my friend Carlo Johnson and I sat down and recorded on a cheap microphone and my laptop and so Reservation Boy was born.\n\nBeing proud of my heritage and where I came from is the notion of this song. Because of reservation economics, I had to leave the reservation for school and work and the song talks about me missing my mom and dad.  The song also pleads \u201cso mama\/daddy please don\u2019t leave me in this lonely city.\u201d\n\nIndian Girl\n\n\u201cAt the end of a 7 year relationship, I found myself single and unsure of myself in the game. I had a lot of time on my hands and spent quite a bit of it in downtown Albuquerque at the music venues and eateries. During that time I was smitten with a beautiful Jemez Pueblo girl who was waitressing at a diner.  After several lunches, dinners, and breakfasts,  we became friends. \n\nI started to think more and more about her and she was the inspiration for this song. \u2018I see you there so beautiful, I hear you laugh wonderful, I feel your presence so comfortable. Indian girl. I see you walk so gracefully, I hear sing so tenderly, I feel your body right next to me. Indian girl.\u2019  These lyrics sounded my feelings for her and I was happy to be inspired in such a way.  We were never more than friends.\u201d","id":"121862934044"},{"name":"Saving Hearts Foundation","description":"Every year thousands of youth and young adults die from Sudden Cardiac Arrest, which may strike without symptoms or warning signs.

No one knows how old it is but in 1928 Lady George Campbell insisted that when the roads were being tarred to accommodate motor vehicles, the tar be removed from this sacred place. It remained untouched where Travellers married, christened babies and took their dead to be buried in the nearby Hell's Glen woods. It is an insignificant small area of white quartz stones in the shape of a heart. Today it is by-passed by a new road. Landowner who has no knowledge of both the 'heart and the Travelling people's history has neglected the area leaving cattle to trample over the stones. Small fences have been erected but only protect for short periods. The 'heart' desperately cries out to be placed back into the hands of a caring public for restoration.

And you probably have too. As an author, speaker and seminar teacher he brings a lifetime perspective to the \"real world\" life of faith as very few can.\n\nTurbulent times require extraordinary faith.  Or better yet, turbulent times require the faith that Jesus walked and talked about for three years of public ministry.  Jesus talked about a sower, a king, a slave, and a leper, yet most of us have never seen or met one of them. But those were the situations that people of his day understood.\n\nTom Fay looks at the financial and home foreclosure crisis and uses it to describe the same faith that Jesus taught. So whatever your personal crisis is today: debt, illness, death, job, school, family, marriage, etc. there is an answer in the faith that Jesus taught. So often he said, \"Your faith has healed you.\" This book is about that faith.\n\nIs Faith Really Relevant for Your Problems?\n\nJesus talked about the faith of a mustard seed to move a mountain into the sea.  So surely our faith today should be able to move a mountain of debt.  Can God pay your mortgage?  Will the bank accept your \"faith\" for payment?  Mr. Fay shows both biblically and from experience that yes, faith does make mortgage payments.\n\nThis is not a \"feel good\" book. This is not a \"name it and claim it\" book. It is a hard-hitting study of what the genuine Christian faith is all about.  The author looks at faith as an action and not a religion.  Faith requires an action on our part\u2014and it produces an action on God's part. \n\nFinally an Author Who Has Been There!\n\nTom Fay shares the pains, worry and doubt that confronts most of us when embarking on a life of faith.  But he doesn't share it in a sterile laboratory, but in real life.  He has been though it and survived.\n\nBut What If This Book Could Change Your Life!\n\nAnd after having gone through great struggles of faith we find that we have an \"anchor\" that holds us during the next and larger crisis.  The author explains what that anchor might look like and what it can do as a life altering event.\n","id":"593171747361242"},{"name":"Island Savings","description":"Island Savings, a division of First West Credit Union, offers British Columbians on Vancouver Island, Pender Island and Salt Spring Island innovative products, an extensive branch network and local decision making.

She has been fighting this disease for so long, that they can no longer afford all the expenses associated with treatment, traveling, and medications. Over the past 8 years, this terrible disease has caused a tremendous drain on the family, both mentally, physically and financially. She may not be able to receive the needed treatments if we don't find a way to raise money for her continued care. \n\nMy mother has not only had to fight the disease, but also has faced many obstacles along the way because she did not receive the proper medical treatment in the beginning. \n\nIn 2006, she had a lumpectomy to remove a DCIS & also received 38 rounds of radiation to her left chest area. \n\nIn 2008\/2009, she was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. She had a double mastectomy & started reconstruction. She received 8 months of different chemotherapy drugs, including Adriomycin, Cytoxan, Taxol, and Taxotere. She was very ill during her treatment, and lost all her hair. \n\nIn 2009, she had reconstructive surgery. \n\nShe has also had numerous surgeries in addition to these. She had to have ports put in chest twice. She has had to have 2 lumps removed from the left side of chest.\n\nIn 2012, she had another reconstructive surgery because an MRI showed there was a rupture in her right implant. The surgeon also found left over breast tissue that had to be removed.\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, the PET scan showed that the cancer had spread to several areas. So my mother went through chemotherapy again. The doctors tried to shrink the tumors before surgery, but the chemo did not help much. This time she was given Gemcitabine and Carboplatin\n\nIn October of 2012, our mother had surgery to remove lymph nodes under arm. The surgeon said she was full of cancer. It had spread so bad that it was inside and outside all the lymph nodes they removed. The cancer was also in all the flesh, veins, & muscle they removed. The surgeon could not get it all, and left several inoperable tumors around her brachial plexus and 3 lymph nodes in her neck. The surgeon closed her up, and told our family that she was terminal, and there was nothing else they could do. He said he was sorry.\n\nSo in January and February of 2013, our mother received radiation again. The doctors said you should never radiate the same area twice, but the cancer would do worse than the radiation. If they had to operate on the tumors around her brachial plexus, which is the nerves and artery supplying blood to you arm, that they would most likely have to amputate her arm. And since she was terminal, they did not want to put her through this. Numerous doctors at Vanderbilt have told her that the goal of treatment is Quality of life, not Quantity. \n\nMy mother was put on a clinical trial last year. In December of 2013, the CT scan showed she had 15 tumors in her liver. It turns out, she was getting the placebo instead of the real drug. So they started the real medication in January. But then she had complications with lungs and had to be taken off of it. She developed pleural effusion, which means fluid builds up in the lining of the lung. They initially drained over 3 pounds of malignant fluid off left lung. After doing this several time, they put a chest tube in so she could drain the fluid out at home every 2 days. \nThey say she is now developing fluid in right lung also. And the last count showed she had 25 tumors in her liver. \n\nThe doctors had to change her chemo once again, so she has been taking 7 pills a day call Xeloda for months, hoping it would slow the growth of the tumors. \n\nHer scans last week showed that the tumors are all growing, and there are more of them. She also has more tumors in liver and lungs, and the others grew since last scan. She has several other tumors throughout her body. \n\nOur mother had an appointment today to start chemo, but was unable to go due to finances. She needs to go to Vanderbilt to get a new chemotherapy once a week, and they are going to biopsy her liver. She is hoping to be able to go next week, and they are working with her to switch her appointments around.\n\nThis has been going on for eight years, and now they are in need of prayers and donations of any amount to help with all the expenses of medical bills and traveling expenses. \n\nANY PRAYERS OR FINANCIAL SUPPORT IS GREATLY APPRECIATED!","id":"670670959694650"},{"name":"Saving Paws Rescue, Inc.","description":"We believe that there is a home for every animal, no matter what.

I have been going through some medical issues myself and am in school and knew I could not take another dog in (I have two rescues).  Every week I went back to volunteer at the shelter, there she was, along with this black un-neutered male dog \u2013 living in a mostly fallen apart box trailer in a large vacant desert lot.  Although they were very dirty and looked like they\u2019d been on the streets a while, the two dogs were VERY sweet toward me and the people in the shelter and their kids.  Occasionally, the homeless shelter would let her and the black dog into their parking lot area \u2013 which was usually closed.  Her tail was always tucked and very gentle.  Just wanting to tuck her head into the arm or body of a person \u2013 totally seeking comfort.  \n\nOne time \u2013 a couple weeks after meeting her, when I got there to volunteer, Bria was worse than ever and the black dog was badly beat up.  There were new dogs there too \u2013 bigger unneutered males that looked like they had homes but jumped a fence because of the scent of a female.  The new ones were hovering all around her \u2013 wouldn\u2019t leave her alone, even though she only wanted to be with the black dog (her first friend) \u2013 the other dogs wouldn\u2019t let her.  Knowing I couldn\u2019t keep her, I knew I had to get her out of there or she would end up pregnant or worse and not make it through the hot desert summer.  Another volunteer took the black dog to an emergency animal hospital and he was then transferred to the Humane Society for medical treatment \u2013 he is currently stable there.  It was so hard pulling the little black dog out of where he was hiding because he was hurting badly and had a systemic infection, but we got him out and he showed no aggression, was just scared to death that he was getting into a car with someone he didn\u2019t know \u2013 while in the car, despite all his wounds and looked like broken leg, he still crawled from the back seat into her lap.  He fell over on his side on his way into the emergency animal hospital.\n\nBria came home with me that night.  I couldn\u2019t leave her there in the physical condition she was in, in that horrible place with no food, water and shelter in the middle of the desert summer.  I thought she was probably in heat and that\u2019s why all the boys were there \u2013 I knew I had to get her spayed right away.  She had never been in a car before and she kept trying to crawl into my lap and ducking under every overpass (incredibly curious with new sounds) \u2013 but overall she trusted me and so she did well.  Then, coming into the house took 30 minutes.  When she came in she was walking very low on her belly and only because I was coaxing her with chicken.  She clearly had never been in a house before.  She didn\u2019t know what this house thing was all about!!  I gave her huge hugs and rewards for coming in.  Going in and out of doors was tricky for her the first couple days.  She is finally getting the hang of it.  ;)  Right away I had to give her a bath \u2013 thankfully a friend helped me with that.  It took two hours. Like I said she was in bad shape \u2013 cuts, bite wounds (new and old), ground in dirt in her fur and skin, etc.  Truckloads of dirt came off her.  The water initially scared her, but in her good natured, sweet way, she adjusted (putting peanut butter all over the tub didn\u2019t hurt either ;).  Then pouring the cup of water over her for the first time was also frightening for her, but she accepted it \u2013 again peanut butter on the tub helped.  For her, the best part was definitely getting dried off!!!  Oh how good she looked and felt!!  Now she could explore the house with some sparkle in her coat\u2026  what an expedition that was for her\u2026  Walking with tail tucked, looking in each room and exploring.  It was beautiful to see her loosen up as she began to realize she was in a safe place.  She was starving and gobbled down the food I put out for her \u2013 I put my hand in her bowl while she was eating, she did nothing \u2013 did not even tense up.  I pulled the food away while she was eating, she was perfectly behaved (even though she was starving) \u2013  also, she does not tense up when other dogs get around her food either.  Once that was done, I put frontline on her to make sure she was tick and flea free.   For the first time in her short little life, she felt safe and zonked right out.  I took pictures of her at this point \u2013 to document her wounds so that someone could be held accountable if they ever came forward.   \n\nThe next day I introduced her to my two dogs and she immediately was thrilled to see them, especially the boy.  I could tell it eased her even more.  She particularly took to my boy \u2013 she cuddles up next to him whenever she can.  I also took her with me to the Humane Society to see if we (her and I) could beg for a spay appointment asap.  I didn\u2019t want her to get pregnant.  They took us the next day and also gave her all her vaccines, tested for heartworm - negative, and did other deworming just as a precaution.  Although it is not a good time for me, I put it all on my credit card.  I just want her to get a very loving and responsible, forever home.  Her personality is like she dropped from heaven.  She could easily be a therapy dog.  \n\nI did not know she was very early in pregnancy until after the spay.  But, what was developing (looked like 11) had mostly already passed because she was not nourished enough to carry.  It was so sad, but nothing we could do and it could have seriously injured or killed her.  When I picked her up they said she may feel hormonal because this was more complicated than most spays.  But, even after all this, today she is the same old love bug to me, my dogs, and the neighborhood kids.  She is still resting up quite a bit as is to be expected.  \n\nShe is the sweetest thing on four paws.  I have had lots of fosters \u2013 none like this.  She is a one in a million dog.  \n","id":"314318118744392"},{"name":"Saving Her Elegance","description":" S.H.E Inc.  is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which was founded in March of 2015 by two sisters born and raised in Detroit MI.

Our primary role is to save lives on the beach and our 129 Surf Life Saving Clubs protected more than 8.5 million beachgoers last season.\n\n\nSurf Life Saving NSW is the largest surf rescue organisation in Australia. We are a network of volunteer surf lifesavers, professional lifeguards, support operations and drowning prevention infrastructure and systems.\n\nSaving Lives\n\nThe NSW coastline is a beautiful, dynamic and sometimes dangerous place. More than 21,000 active surf lifesavers patrol our beaches on weekends and public holidays each season (September-April).\n\nVolunteer Surf Lifesavers\n\nAn iconic sight on Australian beaches for more than a century, volunteer surf lifesavers are recognised world-wide and provide a unique community service.\n\nSurf lifesavers are easily recognised by the famous red and yellow cap, and their bright red and yellow uniforms.\n\nEmergency Response System\n\nCoordinated through the SLSNSW State Operations Centre, the system has been responsible for saving hundreds of lives over the last few years, most outside of patrol hours or at unpatrolled and sometimes extremely remote locations.\n\nA team of dedicated volunteer State Duty Officers are the backbone of the operation, responding to callouts 24\/7 from Police or Ambulance, tasking the most appropriate Surf Life Saving assets to the scene of coastal accidents or emergencies.\n\nIncidents range from swimmers in distress, rockfishing mishaps, shark attacks, seaches for missing persons, offshore boating accidents, coastal aircraft crashes, lost kayakers or medical emergencies.\n\nProject Blueprint\n\nSurf Life Saving NSW has embarked on a major project to help reduce coastal drowning deaths by assessing every beach and rock platform in NSW over the next few years.\n\nThrough the NSW Water Safety Black Spot Fund, Surf Life Saving NSW is using the expertise of Australian Coastsafe, a wholly-owned business unit of Surf Life Saving Australia, to complete the project.\n\nAn average of 92 people drown in Australian coastal waters every year. New South Wales (NSW) accounts for almost 50% of the national coastal drowning toll. Project Blueprint hopes to contribute to meeting the States goal of a 50% reduction in drowning deaths by the year 2020.\n\nLifeguards\n\nThe Australian Lifeguard Service NSW is an independent division of Surf Life Saving which provides professional lifeguard services to local government, private corporations, sporting organisations and community groups.\n\nSports\n\nSurf sports competitors are also skilled and proficient surf lifesavers. Encouraging involvement in surf sports and offering opportunities to compete for both elite and grassroots-level athletes, helps provide clubs with a steady stream of fit and motivated patrolling members.\n\nMajor surf sports events such as the NSW Surf Life Saving Championships bring thousands of members together to enjoy the true spirit of competition and camaraderie, in many cases forming friendships which last a lifetime.\n\nEach year events including the State, Country, Interbranch, Endurance, Pool Rescue and IRB Championships involve many volunteers, months of preparation and rely on the skills and experience of hundreds of officials, coaches and team managers to be a success.\n\nSurf Life Saving NSW has a comprehensive Surf Sports Development Plan which offers tremendous opportunities for athletes, coaches, mentors and officials to develop skills and improve performance. \n\nSurf Life Saving is much more than just saving lives on the beach. A key priority for us is reaching out to all Australians through Community Education.\n\nWe aim to teach all Australians how to keep themselves and their families safe at the beach. We do this through:\n\nSpecifically targeted campaigns eg. rockfishing, rip currents, multi-lingual surf safety. See more on beach safety\nSchool education programs eg. Beach to Bush\nSurf Ed programs delivered by our Branches and licensed providers\nCommunity courses eg. First Aid, CPR, Junior First Aid... More info on courses\nEngaging the community at fairs, open days, festivals\nCoastal Accommodation Network provides surf safety brochures and information to hotels, resorts, backpackers and camp grounds.\nSupporting our Members\n\nSurf Life Saving supports our 75,000 volunteer members in a variety of ways. We assist clubs and members in recruitment and retention, membership reporting and statistics and a range of member protection initiatives.\n\nThe junior activities or \u2018nippers\u2019 program is huge in NSW and we provide resources and assistance to clubs to help them deliver the program to more than 30,000 members under the age of 14.\n\nWe also run a number of member development programs which offer personal development and leadership training. These include:\n\nJunior Lifesaver of the Year (22 finalists from across the state aged under 14 years)\nYouth Opportunity Makers Workshop (members aged between 15 and 17 years)\nDevelopment Networking Program (members aged between 18 and 25 years)\nMember recognition is very important and our annual Awards of Excellence recognises outstanding achievements from all areas of Surf Life Saving. We also recognise our volunteers through external award programs such as the NSW Volunteer of the Year, NSW Sports Federation Awards and Coastal Environment Awards.\n\nSupporting club operations and activities is also an important role and we provide a range of resources such as the Club Guide, Quality Clubs Program and Governance and Best Practice support. We also assist clubs with their environmental initiatives, culturally and linguistically diverse groups as well as disability programs.\n\nEvent Services\n\nWater Safety and Rescue Services\n\nThe Australian Lifeguard Service is the largest provider of aquatic rescue services in NSW. Our Lifeguards and rescue personnel are highly skilled and trained to provide support services at most sporting, cultural or community events.\n\nOur professionals can be contracted for events such as regattas, ocean swims, film shoots, school excursions and picnics, birthday parties, swimming carnivals and other public or private events.\n\n\nFirst Aid Services\n\nSurf Life Saving NSW has a large team of professional First Aid Officers and Lifeguards who can provide emergency First Aid services at most sporting, school, cultural or community events.","id":"134445603310032"},{"name":"SYD - Saving Yorkshire's Dogs","id":"1496677910617596"},{"name":"Saving by Design","id":"180592678632525"},{"name":"Saving EMILY","description":"We have created \"The Emily Fund\" in honor of Emily and will save and help other animals in need of medical care.","id":"239042566248280"},{"name":"Saving Escape","id":"697961063648279"},{"name":"Saving Leon","description":"Leon has been living on the streets for over a decade.

Dames Saving Danes is the combined vision of three 'Dane Savvy' women who all share a common passion for these gentle giants, the world\u2019s biggest dog with hearts to match.\n\nOur years of experience in rescuing Great Danes tell us that there are still many out there who are in need of and deserve a second chance at life. Rescued Danes come from a wide variety of backgrounds ranging from abandonment, neglect or abuse, as well as owner surrenders. Unfortunately more often than not, Great Danes end up the victim of their family's inexperience or all too busy lifestyle, and develop behavioural issues as a result of spending too much time alone and without adequate exercise. Due to their giant stature, strong leadership as they mature is key, as without it they are unfortunately one of the first breeds to end up being surrendered to a shelter environment, moved from one inexperienced family to another, or worse, sold or given away sight unseen and improperly matched to an owner via the internet. \n \nFor the reasons expressed above, our main priority is to adequately assess and match each Dane in our care to the most suitable family for that particular Dane, while taking the applicants family composition and home environment into consideration. As we know from personal experience, it takes so much more than just an enclosed yard to dedicate the time, the commitment, and the heart required to adequately care for a Great Dane. To ensure that each Dane has the best possible chance at a permanent home, every Dane's personality and behaviour is assessed on intake, and a path for their rehabilitation and training is planned. Any health or veterinary needs are also attended to. Each dog goes through a period of rehabilitation, whether it is in an approved foster home or on our farm with a 'Rehab Pack' of four Danes who excel at teaching these rescued dogs things they may have lost along their way into rescue. For some who carry scars from their past life, that may mean learning how to trust again, how to play, and just how to be a dog. Our \u2018Rehab Pack\u2019 of Danes has a very special power in helping us humans to transform the extremely broken souls much faster and farther than we alone ever could. Our mandatory rehabilitation brings each Dane back to health, optimal behaviour and overall condition prior to their adoption through proper nutrition, natural supplementation when needed, veterinary care, training and adequate exercise.\n  \nThe success of our program centers on our dedicated volunteers and our exceptional commitment, dedication and ability to match each Dane with the right person or family. All applicants go through an extensive screening process to determine their suitability and lifestyle. We have found that in the majority of cases there is a Dane to suit most homes. For successful applicants who are committed to providing the necessary daily requirements like proper nutrition and plenty of exercise, every effort is made to find them the perfect dog. Our meticulous selection process also ensures great care is taken especially when matching Danes with families with small children and\/or other family pets.\n  \nDames Saving Danes is funded entirely from donations, fund-raising and adoption fees that serve to support each Dane while in our care, which includes addressing their nutritional and veterinary needs. Health permitting, all intact Danes will be spayed\/neutered, vaccinated, as well as any emergent health issues addressed and treated prior to their adoption. Once successfully adopted, Dames Saving Danes will continue to honor our commitment to the Danes and their adopters by making available health and training resources and recommendations as needed and by request to help ensure the permanency of their new home.\n\nDames Savings Danes strives to ensure that all of our rescued Great Danes are given a second chance at life, with their health, well-being and happiness being our main goal. \n","id":"705031866240703"},{"name":"FAMILY SAVINGS MAGAZINE","id":"311718347708"},{"name":"Saving Christmas","description":"Saving Christmas is a 2014 American faith-based comedy film directed by Darren Doane and written by Doane and Cheston Hervey.

She almost didn't make it the first night she was in the hospital. Two days later there was suspicion that she had leukemia. Our family had battled cancer with a child before. My oldest son, Jonah, was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma in 2006. After almost a year of chemo and amputation of his leg he was cancer free and has been ever since. Making the choice to amputate was the hardest thing our family had ever faced and we felt very alone. I didn't want other families to feel as alone as we did, so I began reaching out to families. I was soon hired by Oklahoma Family Network and I began a support system for families who have kids diagnosed with cancer. It's now called Families Fighting Childhood Cancer. So, I was visiting the hospital when child life told me about Joy's situation. When the diagnosis of leukemia was confirmed, I asked who would take care of her.  Her parents had been arrested for her neglect. I texted my husband, Jeremy, asking if he would consider caring for a little girl in DHS custody, his one word reply was \"Absolutely\". I called the social worker on my way home, offering to help if we could. It was a whirlwind from there...DHS home visits and paperwork and BAM! I was staying with her in the hospital less than a week after she was diagnosed. Beyond the cancer diagnoses, Joy was facing extreme delays. She was almost three years old and had never walked, only spoke less than 10 words, and was extremely weak. Joy has been undergoing chemotherapy treatments and attending therapies to help her recover. A year after we began caring for her we were blessed with the opportunity to adopt her and make her name officially Joy. We chose \"Joy\" because when we met her she was withdrawn, but now if you meet her she exudes the word joy and it's contagious! Joy is our youngest child of four.  Our other children are Jonah, Judah, and Joanna. If you \"like\" this page you will be kept up to date on her care and progress.

And most certainly burros, their wild counterparts, suffer under the same attitude. But we never thought so. While visiting the Bureau of Land Management's wild horse and burro short term holding facility in Palomino Valley, Nevada, we immediately fell in love with the burros. This facility houses an average of 50 burros at a time that were rounded up from public lands throughout the West. Most of these animals never get adopted. We adopted 3 as soon as we purchased our new home. And that is where Zoe and Lexie's story begins.\n\nZoe's mom Lexie was rounded up from her home in the southern Nevada desert in July of 2013. We adopted her from the BLM Palomino Valley Center shortly after on August 8th, and brought her home a month later with two other burro friends.\n\nLate this winter, we noticed that Lexie may be pregnant. We thought we had a lot of time to prepare for the new arrival. But we had a surprise on April 2. The baby needed a plasma infusion on day 2 because she was not getting enough colostrum from her first time mom. On day 4 we noticed that she was walking on the toes of her hind legs. She was given veterinary treatment for this as well. One of the complications was a wound that went around her pastern. The wound was not getting better, and the tendons were not improving either. One night we called the emergency vet out to the ranch. The wound was treated and the legs were splinted to control the tendons. She was worked on for three days by the veterinarians here at the ranch, but the condition was not improving. She was taken to the house of another caring vet (Dr Ian Lafoon of Large Animal Veterinary Services), so that she could be cared for on a continual basis and she stayed there for 3 weeks. The tendon issue was resolved, but unfortunately the wound did not. Despite much care and speaking with other specialists (Dr Jolly of Step Ahead Farms), the foot needed to be amputated. Equines, unlike smaller animals, can not survive with three legs without putting enormous stress on other areas of the body. So Zoe also needed a prosthetic in order to survive and lead a normal life.\n\nWe were going to make the decision to put her to sleep, but watching her romp, gallop, and buck around the paddock, seemingly unaware of the injury and not exhibiting any pain, nuzzling people, and almost getting in your lap to be loved on, changed our minds, and we began searching for other options.\n\nThis was not an easy decision to make. We have done an enormous amount of research on whether this process is not only fair, but will provide her with a normal life. We are also aware of the care involved after we get her home. Speaking with other donkey owners that have gone through the same experience ( Baby Bella's person Stacey), and with specialist Dr Ted Vlahos at Rocky Mountain Equine Hospital in Sheridan, Wyoming we were given the confidence to proceed.\n\nWe started a Facebook page; Saving Zoe the Baby Burro, set up fundraising accounts, started receiving donations, found a driver and immediately left to make the 3 day 1400 mile journey all the way to Sheridan, Wyoming. They were amazing travelers, and we were so relieved to arrive in Sheridan and get them into the hospital. By the time we arrived home, Zoe's page had 600 likes and because of the kindness of people who donated, we were able to pay the deposit for the surgery.\n\nThe first surgery went extremely well, and Zoe was fully weight bearing on the temporary prosthetic leg right away. She was continuing to improve, and we were sent videos of her running and bucking. But then another unexpected and mysterious tragedy happened. A small wound had developed on the other hind leg, and just as before, did not heal normally. It became necessary to amputate the other foot as well. We were devastated and very confused. One prosthetic was challenging enough and two would be twice as much to care for and twice as expensive. Because of their love for Zoe and Lexie the hospital staff encouraged us to go forward and donated the cost of the second surgery. Again the surgery went very well, and now Zoe is walking on her hind legs without pain probably for the first time since she developed the condition. If all goes as the doctors expect, Zoe will be the first successful double amputee equine. While there have been three other cases of equine double amputees, unfortunately these horses died due to completely unrelated causes. We are hoping that Zoe, due to her small size and age, will be a trailblazer for many equines to come.\n\nWe also think that maybe Zoe could be used as a therapy animal for humans facing the same challenge, as well as increasing the knowledge about equine prosthetics, and donkey health (TMR's the Charlie Project). Our top wish is that Zoe becomes an ambassador for her species by bringing more public attention to the plight of the wild burro and encouraging more adoptions of these wonderful animals. We can't wait to bring them back home!\n\nThese are expensive surgeries and she will need to stay at the hospital getting adjusted to the prosthetics for a few months. The costs range from 5- 8,000 dollars for the hospital plus 3,000 for each prosthetic, and we have spent thousands already trying to fix her leg.\n\nWe have rescued or housed rescued horses (65 of them) and have never asked the community for help. But now, although it is difficult to do, we must in order to save Zoe. \n\nPlease consider making a donation and sharing her page. We also will have a silent auction album that will be added to indefinitely. We thank you all so much for the support and encouragement we have received through the entire process.

At 11:49am our lives would forever change. I get an hour for lunch and usually go home, but today I had all intentions of going to CVS and doing some other errands. So I got in my car and something for some reason took me on my route home. About a mile from home I saw this little kitty sitting along the road. As I made eye contact with her I could see her meowing. I kept going and looked in my rear view and noticed she was still there and didn't scurry off. So being the animal lover I am I threw it in reverse and went back. I called my mom in a panic not knowing what to do. She just kept meowing at me with her big doe eyes. I tried to get her off the road... blowing the horn and saying get off the road kitty. She still didn't move. So I got a stick from along the bank and was going to try to poke her and get her to move. Sometimes cats can be mean so I wasn't sure if she was sick or rabid. As I turned back around I noticed she tried to get up and I could see a pretty big gash in her back leg. I knew right then and there what needed to be done. This cat needed me!! I had a blanket in the back of my car so I scooped her up and put her in the hatch and drove to the Dr Lewis. I told her the whole ride that she was going to be OK. So I rushed her into the vet in a frantic panic. My mom followed closely behind to meet me there. We got her back in the room where I explained to them that I found this precious little girl along the road. They asked me what I wanted to do? I looked at them without even thinking twice and said SAVE HER. As this poor little thing laid on the table while they were looking her over she rolled on her back wanting to play with her little motor just running. Now mind you she had just been hit by a car and she was purring wanting to play. I knew this cat was a survivor and had the will to live. So they put her on a heating pad to keep her warm because she was so cold after being left for dead laying along the road in the pouring down rain. My mom and I sat in the waiting room while they prepared to do an X-Ray to see what was going on. Dr Rachel Teribury who has been amazing and on the case from day one gave us some pretty disheartening news about what this little girl had gone thru! She had 2 fractured front legs, a cracked pelvis, an out of whack right hip and not to mention the huge gash on her hind leg. So again I was asked what do you want to do? And my answer remained the same without thinking twice.. SAVE HER!! So as they prepared to work on my little girl my mom and I left and I returned back to work. I have a pretty amazing boss who understands my crazy ways especially when it comes to animals. All I could think about that afternoon was is she going to make it out of all this! Well this was just the beginning. Dr Rachel called me later that afternoon and explained she made it thru the surgery just fine. So when I went to pick her up Saturday I was taking home a kitty with 2 casts on her front legs and an out of whack hip and cracked pelvis. They said she was going to need LOTS of TLC. And that's just what we have been giving her.  She needed to be confined from my other animals just so they didn't want to play with her or jump on her or anything. Mind you we have 4 dogs and 4 cats so it's not exactly quiet here in KiskoVille. LoL! So we set her up a kennel with lots of soft blankets and a heating pad to keep her temp up. She slept a lot the first 48 hours bc she was still coming down from the sedation and prob the shock of it all. So Sunday rolled around and we kept trying to feed her and she didn't want anything to do with it. I had a big Sunday dinner prepared that day that included a roasted chicken!! Hmmm this def appealed to her. She ate a whole plate full. Later in the evening she kept meowing which she hadn't really done since she had been home. We would come to find out that when she meows and squirms around it means it's time to potty. So she peed like a big girl for us. We have to hold her up under her belly for her to go bc with 2 broken front legs it's kind of hard. Monday morning comes around and we get up and guess what... She slipped a cast off. So we took her to the vet where they would reset it. She is a little bugger. Everything is going good except for this smell I kept smelling.I have the nose of a bloodhound so I smell everything. We take her back to the vet and they check her right leg where it is coming from and discover it is dead. No blood supply. We knew from the get go that it could be a possibility she could lose a leg. So she came home minus one leg. It hurt my heart so bad that she had to go thru this, but she is a darn trooper and it didn't kill her spirit at all. She continued to be her perky self and kept on purring, eating, drinking and going to bathroom. I knew it was going to be a ton of work bc we need to feed her and help her potty. But I have an amazing husband and family who have been with her since day one. When you have help it makes things so much easier. We don't have children so my 9 animals are my babies. Then it was Wednesday October 30th and we noticed that her skin up at the top of her cast on her left arm had looked a little red and sore. So my husband cut some of the cast so it wouldn't rub and we cleaned it with peroxide. We took her to the vet Halloween morning and they looked at it. At 9:23am I got some devastating news from Dr Lewis, he told me that the other leg was dead! I was speechless and heartbroken and mad all at the same time. I asked him what he thought we should do. He suggested putting her down bc a cat with only 2 back legs really wasn't an option bc what would her quality of life be like. And also the financial part of was a big factor. I called my mom devastated and so broken and asked what I should do. My husband was working out of cell range so he wasn't available. I haven't cried that hard since I found out my pap was diagnosed with cancer! That morning was a complete blur. We called Cornell University but they couldn't tell us anything over the phone and they couldn't get us in to even see her until December. Everything internal with Gracie was fine. So as far as her quality of life in that matter she was perfect!! When I look into Gracie's eyes I see a survivor. So it was on.... SAVING GRACIE!! I told them to do whatever they had to do to save her. I told her October 11th she was going to be OK and I don't break my promises!! So they amputated her left front leg. I called down to the vet to check to see how she was doing and if she was comfortable. Steph the tech who also has been a godsend told me that she had rolled herself over and had her head perked up AND she ate an entire bowl of food!! This cat has got the will to live!! I felt so much happiness in my heart when they told me that.  So she came home today November 1st minus 2 legs. She ate for us like a little champ and she is snuggled in her normal sleeping spot in our bed right between my husband and I.  We will NOT give up on her. She is a true survivor that has the will to live like no other. Gracie has won so many hearts and has so many supporters I can't even begin to explain how much that means to us. Some have asked how we could dump all the money we have into a \"stray\", but she is no longer a stray and she hasn't been a stray since October 11th, she is Gracie Kisko. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read Gracie's story and liked her page. Also thank you so very much for the get well cards, the gifts and the donations.

The wind was so strong, the noise deafening with metal, wood, concrete, cars and gunk flying through the sky.  It seemed to last forever.  Why was my face hurting?  The monster made something hit me in the face..oh the pain.\n\nI was lost, alone, no food, water, shelter, no family and was terrified.  Animals were buried and running around everywhere.  I must learn to survive.  What can I do to keep these strangers and animals from hurting me?  All I can do is bark, growl and snarl.  I will scare them so they stay away and not harm me.  Now I am being dragged by something on my neck into a building.  There are so many animals who also look lost and afraid.  Don't touch me!  I am afraid.  My bark and growl does not seem to be working.  My instinct tells me to use my mouth but not too hard. \n\nWho is this smelly lady sitting in front of my cage?  Her smell is peaceful and calming.  She seems to take my stress away.  The smelly lady and man are not afraid of me.  Wait, she is opening the door to my cage.  The smell of her hands are grounding to me.  She talks very loving to me.  I feel acceptance of her and believe their is hope for me.  This is my person.  People call her Bev.\n\nBev makes sure I am cared for.  When she comes to the pen in the warehouse where I am isolated from other people and animals I feel JOY.  When she walks away I cry.  I see the other animals getting shots and medicine.  I am coughing more as each day goes by.  The short time I got medicine does not make my cough better.  I feel so alone and hopeless.  I hear the other people yell things when my person takes me for our daily walks.  They yell \"angry dog\" and tell my person you better not let that dog near me or I will kick the **_* out of her.  I am glad they are afraid but it makes my person sad.  I really want to experience forgiveness and surrender myself to allow a human to love me, but I still just get so scared.\n\nWhere are all the other lost animals being taken.  Why am I left back here in the corner?  I am alone.\n\nWait, my person Bev is back!  She and my other friend Lindie are taking me somewhere.  Oh boy!  Car ride.  Perhaps there is HOPE.  \n\nFrom Bev: We fostered Goldie to keep her from being euthanized.  We are not the perfect solution for her forever home.  I love this girl dearly as does my husband.  Being in our home she has been allowed to heal emotionally and physically.  She loves essential oils and is learning what it means to experience love.  We have now turned to Timm Williams and Jennifer Dale, animal behaviorists, Ruff Life Rehab to work with Goldie on her fear nipping and dominance behavior.  She does not do that with mom but sometimes nips dad.  For her to be the best she can be, she needs his help to accept and love all people and animals.  Will you help us help Goldie?  Any donation will help and be greatly appreciated.  You can donate through PayPal or You Caring. \n\nFollow Goldie's page for the rest of her story and continuing journey to recovery.","id":"658649304146355"},{"name":"Savingestore","id":"807073169378908"},{"name":"Saving Scooby","description":"Scooby was at Ohio pound for 8 mos, just pulled and taken to Chances Rescue Inc. in Appleton WI.
