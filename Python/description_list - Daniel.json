[{"ori_label":0,"name":"Ender's Game","description":"Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.\n\nBut Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails."},{"ori_label":0,"name":"JoinTheLeaders.com","description":"Our Missions\n\n1.

It is the game responsible for introducing the joker into modern packs; this was invented around 1860 to act as a top trump or best bower (from the German word Bauer, \"farmer\", denoting also the jack). It is believed to be closely related to the French game \u00c9cart\u00e9 that was popularized in the United States by the Cornish and Pennsylvania Dutch, and to the seventeenth-century game of bad repute Loo. It may be sometimes referred to as Knock Euchre to distinguish it from Bid Euchre.OriginsEuchre appears to have been introduced into the United States by the early German settlers in the Midwest. and from that region gradually to have been disseminated throughout the nation. It has been more recently theorized that the game and its name derives from an eighteenth-century Alsatian card game named Juckerspiel, a derivative of Triomphe. Also, it may have been introduced by immigrants from Cornwall, England, where it remains a popular game. It is also played in the neighboring county of Devon; one theory is that it was introduced by French or American prisoners of war imprisoned in Dartmoor prison during the early 19th century. Ombre is an ancestral form of Euchre."},{"ori_label":0,"name":"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens","description":"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Teens is a 1998 bestselling self-help book written by Sean Covey, the son of Stephen Covey.

Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. This applies regardless of the number of limbs - even arthropods, with six, eight or more limbs, walk.In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the term walking is used to describe both walking in a park or trekking in the Alps. However, in Canada and the United States the term for a long, vigorous walk is hiking, while the word walking covers shorter walks, especially in an urban setting."},{"ori_label":0,"name":"Larry Smith: Why you will fail to have a great career | Video on TED.com","description":"TED Talks In this funny and blunt talk, Larry Smith pulls no punches when he calls out the absurd excuses people invent when they fail to pursue their passions.  <em>(Filmed at <a href=http:\/\/www.ted.com\/tedx\/events\/2219>TEDxUW<\/a>.)<\/em>"},{"ori_label":0,"name":"Primerica","description":"Primerica is a leading provider of term life insurance.

It's who you are.  \n\nThis is for the fans that love Cloud, not (only) because he is one hot bish... but because of who his character is. Tetsuya Nomura created Cloud to be weak, yet he is the hero. This is for those of us who believe that 'weak' characters can be heros too, and we would have Cloud be no other way.  Cloud is Cloud.\n\nThis is for the fans who played Final Fantasy VII over and over again and continue to play it now - even when technology has offered us new games with stunning graphics (eye candy!).  We are the fans who have been dreaming of remakes and sequels from the very beginning.  And now, Square Enix has granted our wishes by literally showering us with Final Fantasy VII fan service.
