[{"ori_label":0,"name":"Zero to One","description":"The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won\u2019t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won\u2019t create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren\u2019t learning from them.\n \nIt\u2019s easier to copy a model than to make something new: doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1. The act of creation is singular, as is the moment of creation, and the result is something fresh and strange.\n \nZero to One is about how to build companies that create new things. It draws on everything Thiel has learned directly as a co-founder of PayPal and Palantir and then an investor in hundreds of startups, including Facebook and SpaceX.\n \nThe single most powerful pattern Thiel has noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas. Ask not, what would Mark do? Ask instead: What valuable company is nobody building?"},{"ori_label":0,"name":"engVid","description":"engVid.com provides free English lesson videos to students around the world.

My name is Brandon and I began Humans of New York in the summer of 2010, shortly after leaving my job in Finance.  (OK, I actually got fired.)  I started HONY because I thought it would be really cool to create an exhaustive catalogue of New York City's inhabitants, so I set out to photograph 10,000 New Yorkers and plot their photos on a map.  Somewhere along the way, I began to interview my subjects in addition to photographing them.  And alongside their portraits, I'd include quotes and short stories from their lives.\n\nTaken together, these portraits and captions became the subject of a vibrant blog. HONY now has over ten million followers on social media, and provides a worldwide audience with daily glimpses into the lives of strangers on the streets of New York City. \n\n------------------------\nIf you'd like to say \"hello\" : honybrandon@gmail.com\nAnything business-related : honyassist@gmail.com\n"},{"ori_label":0,"name":"Communitech","description":"Communitech is located in Waterloo Region, 110 kilometres (66 miles) west of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
