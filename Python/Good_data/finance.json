Typically, they encompass one or more of government finance, fiscal policy, and financial regulation, but there are significant differences between countries:  in some countries the finance minister might also have oversight of monetary policy (while in other countries that is the responsibility of an independent central bank);  in some countries the finance minister might be assisted by one or more other ministers (some supported by a separate government department) with respect to fiscal policy or budget formation;  in many countries there is a separate portfolio for general economic policy in the form of a ministry of \"economic affairs\" or \"national economy\" or \"commerce\";  in many countries financial regulation is handled by a separate agency, which might be overseen by the finance ministry or some other government body. Finance ministers are also often found in governments of federated states or provinces of a federal country.

We are far less comfortable with the stock market. Fewer than half of us are able to answer basic financial literacy questions when surveyed.\n\nWe still don\u2019t know how to prepare ourselves for our financial futures, which would give us power as we work through the inevitable hardships that define human life.\n\nOur goal at GoGirl Finance is to empower and encourage women, to not feel alone in the paths chosen, no matter what they are. We can all learn from each other so share you stories, we want to hear from you."},{"ori_label":53,"name":"Christian Personal Finance","description":"Inspiring quotes, funny stuff, and helpful articles and tools to help you pay off your debt, save more money, and give more! www.christianpf.com\n\nWe have a goal to make more money, save it, invest it wisely, and give it to benefit the lives of others.

The primary goal of corporate finance is to maximize or increase shareholder value. Although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms, rather than corporations alone, the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms.Investment analysis (or capital budgeting) is concerned with the setting of criteria about which value-adding projects should receive investment funding, and whether to finance that investment with equity or debt capital. Working capital management is the management of the company's monetary funds that deal with the short-term operating balance of current assets and current liabilities; the focus here is on managing cash, inventories, and short-term borrowing and lending (such as the terms on credit extended to customers)."},{"ori_label":53,"name":"Just Cars Finance","description":"Whether you are a private buyer, a business owner or buying your new car as part of a salary sacrifice it pays to have a specialist that can assist you with your car finance.

It is the branch of economics which assesses the government revenue and government expenditure of the public authorities and the adjustment of one or the other to achieve desirable effects and avoid undesirable ones.The purview of public finance is considered to be threefold: governmental effects on (1) efficient allocation of resources, (2) distribution of income, and (3) macroeconomic stabilization.OverviewThe proper role of government provides a starting point for the analysis of public finance. In theory, under certain circumstances, private markets will allocate goods and services among individuals efficiently (in the sense that no waste occurs and that individual tastes are matching with the economy's productive abilities). If private markets were able to provide efficient outcomes and if the distribution of income were socially acceptable, then there would be little or no scope for government. In many cases, however, conditions for private market efficiency are violated. For example, if many people can enjoy the same good at the same time (non-rival, non-excludable consumption), then private markets may supply too little of that good. National defense is one example of non-rival consumption, or of a public good.\"Market failure\" occurs when private markets do not allocate goods or services efficiently. The existence of market failure provides an efficiency-based rationale for collective or governmental provision of goods and services. Externalities, public goods, informational advantages, strong economies of scale, and network effects can cause market failures. Public provision via a government or a voluntary association, however, is subject to other inefficiencies, termed \"government failure.\""},{"ori_label":53,"name":"Electronica Finance Ltd","description":"EFL is Non-Banking Finance Company (NBFC) and engaged in MSME Finance in India.

Nandakumar, the Chairman of the Group.\nManappuram's origins go back to 1949 when it was founded in Valapad (a coastal village in the Thrissur District of Kerala) by the late V.C. Padmanabhan, father of Shri Nandakumar. Its activity was mainly pawn broking and money lending carried out on a modest scale. The principal asset of the company was the integrity and foresight of its Founder and among the people of the area it soon acquired a reputation as a safe-haven for their investments.\n\nThe expansion: Shri Nandakumar took over the reins of this one Branch business in the year 1986 when his father expired. Since then, it has been a story of unparalleled growth, with new milestones being crossed every year. And today, it has grown into the Manappuram Group with nine companies in its fold having diverse interests in Gold Loans, Asset Financing, Insurance, Foreign Exchange, Money Changing, and most recently, retail gold jewellery and affordable Healthcare. The group's flagship, Manappuram Finance Ltd. (MAFIL), is India's first listed, highest credit rated gold loan company and widely recognised as one of leading wealth creators in the Indian stock market in recent times. Incidentally, all the group companies including MAFIL continue to be head-quartered at Valapad.\n\nManappuram Finance Ltd. is now recognised as a leading national player in its core activity of gold loans. Established in the year 1992 (the original name was Manappuram General Finance and Leasing Limited), the company has since maintained a consistently rapid pace of growth. Today, it has over 2,500 branches across 22 states with Assets under Management (AUM) exceeding Rs.10,000 crores, a workforce of about 18,000 and a live customer base of 12 lakhs.\n\nThe many achievements: Soon after it commenced its operations, Manappuram Finance gathered several \"firsts\" to its credit. The company was the First NBFC in Kerala to receive a Certificate of Registration issued by the RBI. It was the first Kerala based NBFC to get a Credit Rating in 1995 of \"MA\" (current rating MA+) from ICRA, recognising the company's ability to make timely repayments of the principal and interest under its Public Deposit Programme. Manappuram Finance was one of the very first NBFCs from Kerala to go for a Public Issue of its shares in 1995. In fact, the company has been consistently making profits and paying dividends from the very first full year of operations.\n\nThe company was also the first NBFC from Kerala to issue bonus shares in the ratio of 1:1 in 2007 and then, repeat the feat twice, in 2010 and in 2011 (making it three such instances in five years). Moreover, in 2007, MAFIL became the first Kerala based NBFC to receive foreign Investment from FIIs, and also get the highest short term credit rating of A1+ from ICRA. In 2010, it became the very first Kerala-based company to offer ESOPs (Employee Stock Option Plan) to its middle and senior management functionaries. In April 2011, it became only the second listed company from Kerala to have its shares traded in the \"A-Group\" at the Bombay stock exchange.\n\nOther activities: As part of its diversification, Manappuram Finance has also ventured into the Foreign Exchange business with the Reserve Bank of India giving the company an Authorised Dealer - II licence which permits it to effect outward remittances for a variety of purposes such as overseas medical treatment, higher education abroad, business travel, conferences etc. The Company has commenced Instant Money Transfer in collaboration with UAE Xchange, Wallstreet and MoneyGram.\n\nHuman Resources: As an organization that prides itself as a pioneer and innovator, MAFIL derives its strength from the dedication of its highly motivated staff. Right from inception, the company has been keen to spot the best available talent. The HR department of the company places emphasis on professionalism and in honing the skills of employees to maintain the edge in a competitive world. The company has a full-fledged training establishment where in-house training courses are regularly conducted in a professional manner to upgrade skills and to enhance functional efficiency. Moreover, the company sponsors an MBA degree programme for its employees who have completed five years of service keen to upgrade their professional skills and qualifications.\n\nThe vision: In the next four to give years, MAFIL hopes to emerge as the largest player in the gold loan sector in India. The Company also hopes to expand its footprint to a global level in due course. The long term vision of the company is to unlock the value of India's large stock of privately held gold (estimated at about 18,000 tonnes) to the benefit of the common people of India, most of whom possess savings in the form of gold jewellery. This is best summed up in the Company's corporate tagline, \"Energising gold, empowering lives\"."},{"ori_label":53,"name":"Ministry of Finance, Ghana","description":"Functions\nFormulate and implement sound fiscal and financial policies\nEffective mobilization and efficient allocation of resources\nImprove public financial management\n\nWE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR:\n\nMobilization of external and internal resources\nAllocation of resources to all sectors of the economic\nEnsuring sustainability of public debt\nPreparation and implementation of the annual budget and economic and financial statement of Government\nManagement of public expenditure\nDevelopment and implementation of financial sector policies"},{"ori_label":53,"name":"Finance EZI Racing","description":"Welcome to the Finance Ezi Racing Team\u2019s official Facebook page.

What once started off as a mere business program, soon flourished and eventually evolved into what is now considered to be China\u2019s top finance university (ACU University Rankings 2010-2012), and one of the top business universities.\nSUFE was one of the very first universities in China to create post-doctoral research centers in the fields of economics and management, and it was also one of the leading universities to first offer MBA and EMBA programs.\n\nModern Day SUFE\n\nMoving into the 21st century, the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics is at the cutting edge of economic and accounting research in China. SUFE has been selected as one of the key universities in China\u2019s \u201c211 Project\u201d, a national state-sponsored program to foster the development of outstanding Chinese universities.\n\nThe University\n\nCurrently, there are over 20 schools and colleges in the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.

The task of customs revenue collection was given to the private sector on contract since the institutional base was weak and fragmented at that time. However the modern era of customs begins with the trade treaty with India in 1950. As a result, inner customs offices were closed and borders offices started to work as customs offices. After 1950, Tariff Board used to determine customs rates in accordance of which tariffs used to be levied. In 1956, all bazaar addas (border offices) were turned into customs offices.
