For more details on Smart City visit http://malta.smartcity.ae The land value in the next decade is expected to rise.\n \nAdditional Information on Haz-Zabbar \n\u0126a\u017c-\u017babbar is bound to the north by Kalkara and Xg\u0127ajra, to the west by Fgura and Cottonera fortifications (enclosing the localities of Vittoriosa and Cospicua - the Historical Three Cities), to the east by Marsaskala.  \n\nThe town was used as an encampment by the Ottoman armies at the outset of the Great Siege and later as a base by the Maltese insurgents against French rule in around 1800. A memorable battle took place in front of the \u0126a\u017c-\u017babbar Sanctuary. To this day, French-era cannonballs are to be seen in household walls in the city's older parts and some are also in the church museum after being retrieved from the old church dome.  \u0126a\u017c-\u017babbar was granted city status by the last Grand Master on Malta, Ferdinand de Hompesch, in whose name the population built a triumphal arch on the main approach road from Paola through Fgura.  During the British era a number of forts and batteries were built in the area. These were Fort St Rocco, Fort St Leonardo, Delle Grazie Battery and Zonqor Battery. Fort St Rocco was built between 1873 and 1875. It was later expanded and 3 cannons were fitted. Also, Fort St leonardo was fitted with 4 cannons. These two forts took care of the neighboring seas. The two batteries also took care of the area altogether with the Rinella battery which contains the famous 100 ton Armstrong Gun.\n \nAdditional Information on the Historical Three Cities\nThe Three Cities offer an intriguing insight into Malta and its history. Left largely unchanged, these cities area slice of authentic life as well as a glimpse into Malta's maritime fortunes. The Three Cities can rightly claim to be the cradle of Maltese history, as Vittoriosa, Senglea and Cospicua have provided a home and fortress to almost every people who settled on the Islands. Their harbour inlets have been in use since Phoenician times: the docks always providing a living for local people, but also leaving them vulnerable when Malta's rulers were at war. As the first home to the Knights of St. John, the Three Cities' palaces, churches, forts and bastions are far older than Valletta's. The local communities here celebrate holy days and festas as nowhere else on the Islands. The most spectacular events are the Easter processions when statues of the \"Risen Christ\" are carried at a run through crowded streets.\n \nAdditional Information on il-Kalkara\nIl-Kalkara is a small picturesque village in Malta, with a population of 2,999 as of March 2011. The village of Kalkara developed as a small fishing community around the sheltered inlet of Kalkara Creek. Some historians believe that the land that today is known as Kalkara, was one of the first to be inhabited by the initial dwellers of Malta that came from nearby island of Sicily. The idea behind this theory is that the inlets of the Grand Harbour could have provided these primitive emigrants with the needed shelter after having endured their long voyage in the Mediterranean Sea. Nevertheless such theories cannot be proven and Kalkara's early history will remain largely unknown.\n\nKalkara is located on the eastern coast of Malta and forms part of the inner harbour area of the Grand Harbour. It occupies the area around Kalkara Creek and extends to both valley sides around the creek. Rinella Bay, the only sandy beach in the Grand Harbour, is found at the mouth of the Rinella valley. Kalkara is one of the few localities within the Grand Harbour area which still has relatively large open spaces which naturally divide it from other towns and villages."}, {"ori_label": 23, "name": "Apartment for Sale Costa Del Sol, Andalucia", "description": "Apartment 7I in Flamingo Golf for Sale\n\nPrice Reduced from 180,000 euro to 134,900 euro to sell\n\nContact me on 00353868145539 or email on flamingogolfrental@gmail.com\n\nBuilt - 100 sqm\n3 Beds - 2 baths\nBalcony - 7 sqm\n\n\nLocated in Riviera, Mijas Costa, Costa Del Sol\nApartment coomplex completed 2003\nBasement carparking with electronic key access\nOwn storage lockup in basement\nSafe gated community with intercom access.\nAdult and Childrens pools.\nOpen plan living room with fireplace\nLarge balcony.\nModern kitchen.\nSea Views - Beach approx 4km away.\nIdeal for families, small groups or individuals.\nGolf course and driving range approx 1km away\nExtensive array of quality courses within short distance.\n"}, {"ori_label": 23, "name": "Mieszkanie na sprzeda\u017c / Apartment for sale", "description": "Do sprzedania nowo urz\u0105dzone, ciche mieszkanie z klimatycznym, s\u0142onecznym ogrodem, po\u0142o\u017cone w Miasteczku Wilan\u00f3w w eleganckim budynku przy ul.

This poem is a gift and I want you to keep it\" \"I once had a broker named bad vlad Times with him were happy and sad. We started on the east, After we enjoyed a McDonald's feast, And close comrades we became at once. After murray hill showed us no love, Vlad looked to the heavens above. Told the agents to stop scheming, To keep on believing, And to start our journey out west. At onset there was resistance from the team. Vlad insisted the west was our dream, Gyms and doormen, renovations and more, The ultimate spot to bring back my whores. After finding a spot on 56th, Vlad tells me our offer doesn't exist. More scheming he said, But don't hang your head, We'll find your pimp palace this week. At conclusion of apartment crisis 2012, We continued our search in the kitchen of hells. One place was all it took, Rather gave it a second look, And we decided to finally settle down. Our long journey had ended, A Bulgarian we friended, And we found a place to call home, But at the end of the day, I wouldn't have had it any other way, In our triumphant battle of choosing a place to stay.

Both my roommate and I were looking to move into the city from other areas. We knew the area we wanted to live in, and the price we were willing to pay, but expected very little in terms of what we would find. Vladimir was in constant contact with us from the beginning of our search and was very assuring that we wouldn't necessarily have to lower our standards. The very first apartment he showed us was the one we moved into -- the building was way more luxurious than we were expecting and the rent was within our budget! Vladimir was dedicated to helping us settle on this apartment we wanted, and was in constant dialogue with us throughout the application process. He made himself available to us at all hours of the day and night to answer questions and ensure that we were on the right track. His extensive knowledge of the NYC housing market combined with his honest and friendly demeanor made us extremely comfortable and confident that we were settling on the best choice available. We would absolutely recommend him to anyone looking to buy or rent in the city.\u201d \n\n-Alexi Noelle and Marilyn Mereles\nFebruary 02, 2012\n\n\nI met Vladimir when looking for an apartment to rent in Manhattan.In our first meeting, Vladimir was extremely prepared and showed us exactly the apartments that met our criteria and budget.We were able to finalize a place at the end of the same day.

Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial system and influence on national economies, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.Banking in its modern sense evolved in the 14th century in the rich cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world. In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties \u2014 notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs and the Rothschilds \u2014 have played a central role over many centuries.

As such, a more correct term for 'Islamic banking' is 'Sharia compliant finance'.Sharia prohibits acceptance of specific interest or fees for loans of money , whether the payment is fixed or floating. Investment in businesses that provide goods or services considered contrary to Islamic principles is also haraam . Although these prohibitions have been applied historically in varying degrees in Muslim countries/communities to prevent unIslamic practices, only in the late 20th century were a number of Islamic banks formed to apply these principles to private or semi-private commercial institutions within the Muslim community.As of 2014, sharia compliant financial institutions represented approximately 1% of total world assets. By 2009, there were over 300 banks and 250 mutual funds around the world complying with Islamic principles and as of 2014 total assets of around $2 trillion were sharia-compliant. According to Ernst & Young, although Islamic Banking still makes up only a fraction of the banking assets of Muslims, it has been growing faster than banking assets as a whole, growing at an annual rate of 17.6% between 2009 and 2013, and will grow by an average of 19.7% a year to 2018."}, {"ori_label": 51, "name": "Banking current affairs", "description": "Current affair plays an important role in getting success in any competitive exam, Specially Banking and other Gov.

Online banking is also referred as Internet banking, e-banking, virtual banking and by other terms.To access a financial institution's online banking facility, a customer with Internet access would need to register with the institution for the service, and set up some password for customer verification. The password for online banking is normally not the same as for telephone banking. Financial institutions now routinely allocate customers numbers , whether or not customers have indicated an intention to access their online banking facility. Customers' numbers are normally not the same as account numbers, because a number of customer accounts can be linked to the one customer number. The customer can link to the customer number any account which the customer controls, which may be cheque, savings, loan, credit card and other accounts. Customer numbers will also not be the same as any debit or credit card issued by the financial institution to the customer.To access online banking, a customer would go to the financial institution's secured website, and enter the online banking facility using the customer number and password previously setup. Some financial institutions have set up additional security steps for access to online banking, but there is no consistency to the approach adopted.FeaturesOnline banking facilities offered by various financial institutions have many features and capabilities in common, but also have some that are application specific."}, {"ori_label": 51, "name": "Banking Notes", "description": "Dear Friends!

The city is inhabited by one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, although the size of the community has shrunk due to emigration. Bethlehem was destroyed by the Emperor Hadrian during the second-century Bar Kokhba revolt; its rebuilding was promoted by the Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, who commissioned the building of its great Church of the Nativity in 327 CE.

Services offered include savings and transactional accounts, mortgages, personal loans, debit cards, and credit cards. The term is generally used to distinguish these banking services from investment banking, commercial banking or wholesale banking. It may also be used to refer to a division or department of a bank dealing with retail customers.In the US the term Commercial bank is used for a normal bank to distinguish it from an investment bank. After the great depression, through the Glass\u2013Steagall Act, the U.S. Congress required that banks only engage in banking activities, whereas investment banks were limited to capital markets activities.

At the time, banks in India were either owned by Europeans and served mainly the interests of the European merchant houses, or by different communities and served the banking needs of their own community.

Reserves are held at the bank as currency, or as deposits in the bank's accounts at the central bank. Fractional-reserve banking is the current form of banking practiced in most countries worldwide.Fractional-reserve banking allows banks to act as financial intermediaries between borrowers and savers, and to provide longer-term loans to borrowers while providing immediate liquidity to depositors (providing the function of maturity transformation). However, a bank can experience a bank run if depositors wish to withdraw more funds than the reserves held by the bank. To mitigate the risks of bank runs and systemic crises (when problems are extreme and widespread), governments of most countries regulate and oversee commercial banks, provide deposit insurance and act as lender of last resort to commercial banks.Because bank deposits are usually considered money in their own right, and because banks hold reserves that are less than their deposit liabilities, fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond the amount of the underlying reserves of base money originally created by the central bank. In most countries, the central bank (or other monetary authority) regulates bank credit creation, imposing reserve requirements and capital adequacy ratios. This can limit the amount of money creation that occurs in the commercial banking system, and helps to ensure that banks are solvent and have enough funds to meet demand for withdrawals. However, rather than directly controlling the money supply, central banks usually pursue an interest rate target to control inflation and bank issuance of credit."}, {"ori_label": 51, "name": "Banking Guru Magazine - H", "description": "\u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u0907\u0902\u0936\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0930\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0938 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0917\u0940 \u092a\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0913\u0902 \ufe58 \u090f\u0938\u092c\u0940\u0906\u0908 \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u0906\u0908\u092c\u0940\u092a\u0940\u090f\u0938 (\u092a\u0940\u0913/\u0915\u094d\u0932\u0930\u094d\u0915), \u0906\u0930\u092c\u0940\u0906\u0908 (\u092a\u0940\u0913/\u0915\u094d\u0932\u0930\u094d\u0915), \u090f\u0938\u094b\u0938\u093f\u090f\u091f \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 (\u092a\u0940\u0913/\u0915\u094d\u0932\u0930\u094d\u0915) \u090f\u0932\u0906\u0908\u0938\u0940 (\u0905\u0938\u093f\u0938\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0902\u091f/\u090f\u0913/\u090f\u0921\u0940\u0913), \u090f\u0928\u0906\u0908\u0938\u0940\u090f\u0932 (\u0905\u0938\u093f\u0938\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0902\u091f/\u090f\u0913/\u090f\u0921\u0940\u0913) \u0907\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f \u0915\u0947 \u0905\u0924\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0924 \u0905\u0928\u094d\u092f \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u090f\u0917\u094d\u091c\u093e\u092e \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0937\u094d\u0920 \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0939\u0948 \ufe58 \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u0917\u0941\u0930\u0941\ufe31\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0917\u0940 \u092a\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0915\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u0916\u0915\u0930 \u0924\u0948\u092f\u093e\u0930 '\u0915\u0930\u0947\u0923\u094d\u091f \u0905\u092b\u0947\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0938' \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0915 \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940\u092f \u092e\u0941\u0926\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0941\u0916\u0924\u093e \u0926\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948\ufe31\n\u0915\u0930\u0947\u0923\u094d\u091f \u0905\u092b\u0947\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0915\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u091c\u0941\u095c\u0947 \u0924\u0940\u0928 \u092e\u0939\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923 \u0935\u093f\u0937\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0906\u0932\u0947\u0916 \u0915\u0947 \u0930\u0942\u092a \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u0916\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u094b \u0907\u0938 \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0915\u094b \u092c\u0947\u0939\u0924\u0930 \u092c\u0928\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948\ufe31\n\u0915\u0930\u0947\u0923\u094d\u091f \u0905\u092b\u0947\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0938 \u0915\u0947 \u0905\u0924\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0958\u094d\u0924 \u0938\u0949\u0932\u094d\u0935\u0921 \u092a\u0947\u092a\u0930\u094d\u0938 \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u092e\u0949\u0921\u0932 \u092a\u0947\u092a\u0930\u094d\u0938 \u0907\u0938 \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u0939\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\ufe31\nBOOSTERS \u0915\u0947 \u0930\u0942\u092a \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094d\u092f \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 \u0905\u0902\u0915\u0917\u0923\u093f\u0924 \u0905\u092d\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0917\u094d\u092f\u0924\u093e \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0924\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092a\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923 \u091c\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u092e\u0939\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923 \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u0905\u0927\u094d\u092f\u094d\u092f\u0928 \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0909\u092a\u0932\u092c\u094d\u0927 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u094b \u0905\u092d\u094d\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0938\u092c\u0938\u0947 \u0906\u0917\u0947 \u0930\u0916\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e \u0939\u0948\ufe31"}, {"ori_label": 51, "name": "Banking Asprint", "description": "Bank Exam Preparation\nJoining a Bank job has been the dream of millions of candidates for decades.

It completed the acquisition of FinBank Plc in February 2012 and subsequently merged with FinBank in October 2012. Following the merger, the FCMB Group now has 2 million customers, 275 branches and cash-centres spread across every state of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and a presence in the United Kingdom (through its FSA-authorised investment banking subsidiary, FCMB UK).\n\nFCMB offers financial services across the Federal Republic of Nigeria. As a leading financial services provider, FCMB is committed to serving the interests of its shareholders, customers, staff and the community.

In 2008, it won the Euromoney award for the Best Equity House (Nigeria) and was named the Best Investment Bank in Nigeria at the Euromoney 2007 Awards for Excellence. The Bank had been adjudged Nigeria\u2019s most consistent issuing house/financial advisor 1993\u20131998 by Reuters and SBA Research Limited in June 2000 and was also the winner of the 1999 Platinum Division in the first Reuters sponsored Nigerian Issuing House Awards. In 2000, FCMB also received the inaugural Mergers and Acquisitions award in recognition of its expertise in this area. It has subsequently received the 2001 and 2002 award in the same category.\n\nFCMB is the first and only bank in Nigeria to have held these diverse awards at the same time, and remains the only institution to have won the Mergers and Acquisitions award for three consecutive years. In recent times the Bank has also received recognition for its successful forays outside investment banking, with nomination in 2009 for the most innovative bank in Africa by African Banker Magazine.\n\nOur business is structured along one market-facing division (Corporate Banking), three regions and six associated companies.

The three banks were merged in 1921 to form the Imperial Bank of India, which upon India's independence, became the State Bank of India in 1955. For many years the presidency banks had acted as quasi-central banks, as did their successors, until the Reserve Bank of India was established in 1935, under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.In 1960, the State Banks of India was given control of eight state-associated banks under the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959.

In Pakistan too, Islamic Banking is making inroads into conventional banking as more Islamic banks become operational. Recognizing the need for human resource development in the expanding field of Islamic Banking, University of Management and Technology has taken the lead in establishing the Institute of Islamic Banking (IIB) at its main campus at Lahore. Under the patronage of Dr Hasan Sohaib Murad, Rector UMT, it is a pioneering initiative as the new Institute embarks on an ambitious multidimensional program.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe University of Management and Technology (UMT) is committed to the noble task of dissemination of knowledge for the development of human beings enabling them to undertake divine responsibilities ensuing from their distinguished position as vicegerents (Khalifah) of God on earth. Besides compulsory courses in Islamic Studies at the undergraduate level, UMT also offers graduate courses to students to infuse in them the spirit of dedication for Islamic norms and values so that they not only excel in their worldly profession but also become practicing Muslims. As such, the teaching of Islamic Studies has a special place in the scheme of studies at UMT. Even before getting the university charter, two courses of Islamic Studies (3 credit hours each) were being offered at the Institute of Leadership and Management (ILM) as it was known at the time. The first course titled 'Islam and Personality' focused on the basic teachings of Islam and their role in developing a Muslim personality. The second course called 'Islam, Society and Systems' looked at Islam as a system of social governance offering solutions to contemporary issues and challenges faced by Muslim societies.\n\nThe IIB is simultaneously engaged at three major fronts. Its activities and programs are geared towards becoming a leading source of education, research and information in Islamic Banking. At the same time, IIB aims to become a self-sustaining arm of the University by generating substantial revenues through academic programs, consultancy and products sales. In the area of academic training and research, IIB is offering postgraduate degrees in three disciplines: Islamic Banking, Islamic Finance, and Islamic Economics. Moreover, with the participation of several reputed scholars from the Muslim world and elsewhere, IIB is ready to launch a refereed quarterly journal called Islamic Banking and Finance Review.\n\nIn order to fill the gap in trained manpower, IIB is launching a monthly series of Executive Development Programs for the banking industry. With the cooperation of UMT's Center for Management Development (CMD), these seminars will introduce the participants to the conceptual basis of Islamic Banking and how this can be translated into operational terms in this transition from conventional to Shariah based financial practices. Fully cognizant of the fact that HRD and R&D resources in Islamic Banking are in disarray for lack of a systematic approach, IIB intends to become a world leader in providing one-stop access to academic research, and human resources in Islamic Banking and Finance. To accomplish these goals, IIB has initiated several projects to develop retrospective and current bibliography, glossary, monographs, database, and a digital library on Islamic Banking."}, {"ori_label": 51, "name": "Banking and Investments Association - BIA", "description": "BIA's mission: \n\n\"To serve as a platform for students to connect and foster the growth of student empowerment in business related fields\" \n"}, {"ori_label": 51, "name": "Banking", "description": "VAY TI\u1ec0N NHANH-L\u00c3I SU\u1ea4T TH\u1ea4P t\u1eeb c\u00e1c ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng Vietnam.\nth\u1ee7 t\u1ee5c photo nhanh gon.\nLH 0979.184.637"}, {"ori_label": 51, "name": "Bank Syariah Mandiri", "description": "Follow us on twitter @syariahmandiri"}, {"ori_label": 51, "name": "Bangkok Bank", "description": "Bangkok Bank Public Company Limited , is a Thai commercial bank with approximately US$78 billion in total assets .

While lying in a hospital bed after a major heart attack, Edgar Cahn, a civil rights lawyer and speech writer for Robert Kennedy, was feeling helpless - similar to the disenfranchised and unemployed. This experience gave him the idea to create a new system of money as a tool to connect people and neighbors called Time Dollars. With this new idea several individuals begin forming time banks in their neighborhoods. The word spreads fast as people are hungry for this new way of exchange that doesn't involve cash, but instead taps into the capacity of their local community. Living with this new complimentary currency, time bankers discover the power of networking with their neighbors. With using the time dollars as currency, members bring improvement to their personal lives. This spirit of improvement grows into the greater community with larger-scaled time bank projects. Time bankers become part of the larger community projects giving them ownership in the effort and empowering them to give direction in their community. City officials and policy makers start to realize the positive differences in their areas and give recognition to the contribution that time banks are making. With all the popularity that time banks have achieved, the uncertainty of longevity after an economic upturn comes into question on whether or not people still need time banks when money is no longer scarce. However, time bankers have realized the connection to neighbors and the bonds with their community are more valuable than the money saved. Edgar Cahn, in his campaign for a collective force for system change, visits Los Angeles where time bank leaders from across the nation converge to learn from each other and organize a national advocacy voice."}, {"ori_label": 51, "name": "Banking, SSC & Other Govt Exams Preparation", "description": "Are you preparing for Banking, SSC and other JOB related Entrance Examinations?

team which reports news about credit cards, debit cards and other aspects of personal finance. The staff recently won a Society of American Business Editors and Writers award for its coverage of the Credit CARD Act of 2009. It also worked in conjunction with the White House on a video town hall discussion of the CARD Act. "}, {"ori_label": 31, "name": "Credit card", "description": "A credit card is a payment card issued to users as a system of payment. It allows the cardholder to pay for goods and services based on the holder's promise to pay for them. The issuer of the card creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance.A credit card is different from a charge card: a charge card requires the balance to be paid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. A credit card also differs from a cash card, which can be used like currency by the owner of the card. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.The size of most credit cards is \u00d7 \u00a0in (85.60 \u00d7 53.98\u00a0mm), conforming to the ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 standard. Credit cards have a printed or embossed bank card number complying with the ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard. Both of these standards are maintained and further developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17/WG 1. Before magnetic stripe readers came into widespread use, plastic credit cards issued by many department stores were produced on stock (\"Princess\" or \"CR-50\") slightly longer and narrower than 7810. Some modern credit cards have a computer chip embedded in them for security reasons."}, {"ori_label": 31, "name": "Bangkok Bank Credit Card", "description": "Our Credit Cards Giving you the spending power you want.\nGet purchasing power when you need it with a Bangkok Bank Credit Card.

A credit card also differs from a cash card, which can be used like currency by the owner of the card. Most credit cards are issued by banks or credit unions, and are the shape and size specified by the ISO/IEC 7810 standard as ID-1. This is defined as 85.60 \u00d7 53.98 mm (33/8 \u00d7 21/8 in) in size."}, {"ori_label": 31, "name": "Credit card fraud", "description": "Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for theft and fraud committed using or involving a payment card, such as a credit card or debit card, as a fraudulent source of funds in a transaction. The purpose may be to obtain goods without paying, or to obtain unauthorized funds from an account. Credit card fraud is also an adjunct to identity theft. According to the United States Federal Trade Commission, while identity theft had been holding steady for the last few years, it saw a 21 percent increase in 2008. However, credit card fraud, that crime which most people associate with ID theft, decreased as a percentage of all ID theft complaints for the sixth year in a row.Although incidence of credit card fraud is limited to about 0.1% of all card transactions, this has resulted in huge financial losses as the fraudulent transactions have been large value transactions. In 1999, out of 12 billion transactions made annually, approximately 10 million\u2014or one out of every 1200 transactions\u2014turned out to be fraudulent. Also, 0.04% (4 out of every 10,000) of all monthly active accounts were fraudulent. Even with tremendous volume and value increase in credit card transactions since then, these proportions have stayed the same or have decreased due to sophisticated fraud detection and prevention systems. Today's fraud detection systems are designed to prevent one twelfth of one percent of all transactions processed which still translates into billions of dollars in losses.In the decade to 2008, general credit card losses have been 7 basis points or lower (i.e. losses of $0.07 or less per $100 of transactions). In 2007, fraud in the United Kingdom was estimated at \u00a3535 million."}, {"ori_label": 31, "name": "Credit Cards", "description": "Keeping on top of your credit cards and making sure you are getting the best available rates and interest free periods is important. \n\nComparison credit cards understand this and want to make sure that you have access to the leading UK credit card deals. \n\nUse the comparison tables to compare some of the best credit card deals side by side and apply online today."}, {"ori_label": 31, "name": "Barclays Credit Cards", "description": "Enjoy a world of privileges, high credit limits, exclusive discounts and promotions with leading brands with your Barclays Gold Card.

The Times actually stated, \u201cThe Square is beautiful and dog-simple.\u201d First, the Square app must be downloaded on the particular technology being used, which is only available for download on these specific types: iPhones, iPod touches, iPads, and Androids. All that is left to do for the setup after the app has been downloaded, is you must sign up for and create an account and enter quite a bit of personal information. Once you are registered, Square sends you a free card reader, and then once you connect I it into the headphone jack of your device, it immediately can begin accepting payments. This type of system works over any Wi-Fi and or a cell phone data connection. Now for you, making money is easy. You choose an amount, and swipe away. For those people who run their own type of businesses and sell only a small number of items can also set up a virtual shelf with all of the items for sale. This makes it easy when taking payments, because all you need to do is choose which item someone is purchasing and then the Square automatically calculates a total. Once the buyer swipes their card, a receipt is prepared, which includes the charges, location, or the company\u2019s logo. The customer then must sign the receipt on the phone\u2019s screen using their own finger, and they also must choose to either have the receipt e-mailed to them or sent as a text message."}, {"ori_label": 31, "name": "Naija Credit Cards", "description": "Welcome to www.NaijaCreditcards.com.

It was also issued in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland by Ulster Bank, a subsidiary of NatWest, Northern Bank, then a subsidiary of Midland; and Bank of Ireland, which was otherwise unconnected to the founder banks.The card scheme was run from several offices in Southend-on-Sea in Essex, England, by the Joint Credit Card Company with the main site being located at Priory Crescent, the former home of Ekco.

Card issuers refer to the leading six digits on the card as an \"issuer identification number (IIN)\", or \"bank identification number (BIN)\". On rare occasions they are referred to as Bank card numbers. The remaining numbers on the card are referred to as the primary account number or PAN. IINs and PANS have a certain level of internal structure and share a common numbering scheme. Bank card numbers are allocated in accordance with ISO/IEC 7812. This technical standard has two parts - Part 1 identifies the structure of the Issuer Identification Number. Part 2 identifies the application procedures and eligibility requirements for obtaining an IIN. The bank card number (or as it is commonly known - the IIN) identifies the issuer of the card, which is then electronically associated by the issuing organization with one of its customers and then to the customer's designated bank accounts. In the case of stored-value type cards, there is no necessary association with a particular customer.ISO/IEC 7812 IINs are 6 digits in length, and can be up to 19 digits. The structure is as follows:  a six-digit Issuer Identification Number (IIN), the first digit of which is the Major Industry Identifier (MII), a variable length (up to 12 digits) individual account identifier, a single check digit calculated using the Luhn algorithm. The bank card number differs from the Bank Identifier Code (BIC/ISO 9362, a normalized code - also known as Business Identifier Code, Bank International Code and SWIFT code).

Wriston, the card followed the bank's purchase of an interest in the Carte Blanche charge card. However, the card proved to be limited by its regional scope, as it was tied to the area surrounding the bank's New York base of operations.In 1969, the card was absorbed into Master Charge (now known as MasterCard), another card that had been developed by a membership association of four banks, the Interbank Card Association, which National City Bank joined.Citibank, as First National City Bank came to be known in 1976, made a further attempt in 1977 to create a proprietary credit card that was not tied to either Master Charge or Visa.

The contestant from Contestants' Row who bids closest to the price of a prize without going over wins the prize and has the chance to win additional prizes or cash in an onstage game. After the pricing game ends, a new contestant is selected for Contestants' Row and the process is repeated. Six pricing games are played on each hour-long episode; three games per episode were played during the half-hour format. With the exception of a single game from early in the show's history, only one contestant at a time is involved in a pricing game.A total of 107 pricing games have been played on the show, 75 of which are in the current rotation. On a typical hour-long episode, two games\u2014one in each half of the show\u2014will be played for a car, at most one game will be played for a cash prize and the other games will offer merchandise or trips. Usually, one of the six games will involve grocery products, while another will involve smaller prizes that can be used to win a larger prize package.On the 1994 syndicated version hosted by Doug Davidson, the rules of several games were modified and other aesthetic changes were made. Notably, the grocery products used in some games on the daytime version were replaced by small merchandise prizes, generally valued less than $100. Episodes of The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular that aired in 2008 and both Big Money Week and Dream Car Week featured rule changes to some pricing games.

MUST Shop Around For The BEST Value & Benefits:\r\n\r\nValues & Benefits can vary greatly: And in some cases, credit cards might seem like great deals until you read the fine print and disclosures. When you\u2019re trying to find the credit card that\u2019s right for you, look at the:\r\n\r\nAnnual fees: Many issuers charge annual membership or participation fees. Some card issuers assess the fee in monthly installments.\r\n\r\nAnnual percentage rate (APR): The APR is a measure of the cost of credit, expressed as a yearly interest rate. It must be disclosed before your account can be activated, and it must appear on your account statements. The card issuer also must disclose the \u201cperiodic rate\u201d  the rate applied to your outstanding balance to figure the finance charge for each billing period. \r\n\r\nBalance calculation methods: You should understand that credit cards companies use three main balance calculation methods: average daily balance, previous balance, and adjusted balance. The most commonly used method of calculating your balance is the average daily balance. This method adds up your average daily balances for each day during the month, divides the total by the number of days in the month, and multiplies the result by your monthly interest rate (your APR divided by twelve).\r\n\r\nCash advances: Avoid using cash advances? Cash advances are an extremely expensive way to borrow money. Interest begins to accrue as soon as you get a cash advance, because cash advances are not considered normal credit card charges generally, the interest rate charged on cash advances is higher than the interest rate charged on purchases. In addition, there is usually a cash advance fee of between 1.5  and  5  percent of the cash amount advanced.\r\n\r\nCompounding period: The compounding period is how often interest is charged to your account. Most credit card company compound interest daily. It\u2019s interesting to note that when you save money, interest is compounded monthly, but when you borrow money interest is compounded daily. Any time you borrow money, remember that you are paying interest, not earning it.\r\n\r\nGrace period: The grace period is the number of days you have to pay your billing full without triggering a finance charge. For example, the credit card company may say that you have 25 days from the statement date, provided you paid your previous balance in full by the due date. Cards Issuers Companies grace periods may Vary.\r\n\r\nInterest rate: Credit card companies state the interest rate as an annual percentage rate, or APR. This is the true, simple, interest rate that is charged over the life of the loan. However, the APR does not take into account compounding periods or the time value of money.\r\n\r\nTransaction fees and other charges: Some issuers charge a fee if you use the card to get a cash advance, make a late payment, or exceed your credit limit. Some charge a monthly fee if you use the card or if you don\u2019t.\r\n\r\n*\u201dRead the Card\u2019s Terms & Conditions\u201d*"}, {"ori_label": 31, "name": "Accept Credit Cards at your Business", "description": "Free retail, online, smart phone or wireless point of sale credit card processing equipment with merchant account services.

Debt accumulates and increases via interest and penalties when the consumer does not pay the company for the money he or she has spent.The results of not paying this debt on time are that the company will charge a late payment penalty (generally in the US from $10 to $40) and report the late payment to credit rating agencies. Being late on a payment is sometimes referred to as being in \"default\". The late payment penalty itself increases the amount of debt the consumer has.When a consumer has been late on a payment, it is possible that other creditors, even creditors the consumer was not late in paying, may increase the interest rates the consumer is paying. This practice is called universal default.Research shows that people with credit card debt are more likely to forgo needed medical care than others, and the likelihood of forgone medical care increases with the magnitude of credit card debt.StatisticsQuarterly Credit Card Debt in the United States Since 2010 :  Q2 2012: $798.5 Q1 2012: $790.3 Q4 2011: $834.4 Q3 2011: $799.5 Q2 2011: $794.3 Q1 2011: $786.0 Q4 2010: $833.1 Q3 2010: $819.2 Q2 2010: $830.5 Q1 2010: $843.1 Credit Card debt in other countries:  United Kingdom \u00a364.7 billion Australia $50 billion  Declines in credit card debt are often misinterpreted because they fail to include information about charge-offs. The possible causes for a decline in credit card debt are consumers paying down their debt, credit card companies writing charged-off debt off their books, or a combination of the two. Inclusion of charged-off debt can therefore significantly impact debt trends and the characterization of a nation\u2019s financial health. For example, the $10.3 billion decrease in outstanding credit card debt in Q3 2010 relative to the previous quarter might at first glance seem to be a significant consumer pay down. However, considering that the Q3 credit card charge-off rate was $16.9 billion, consumers actually increased their overall debt by $6.6 billion during this quarter."}, {"ori_label": 31, "name": "Credit Card Debt Solution", "description": "Kenapa perlu membayar lebih kepada pihak bank??.Hentikan membayar 18% p.a Faedah kredit!\nAdakah anda ingin masih mahu meneruskan membayar kaedah kad kredit 18% setahun,bertahun-tahun?\nAnda tidak mempunyai tunai yang mencukupi dan tidak mampu untuk menyelesaikan baki kad kredit yang belum dibayar dalam waktu terdekat?? ------> Runsing dan sesak nafas.\nMaka solusinya sekarang anda mempunyai pilihan untuk berhenti membayar kadar faedah yang tinggi aitu 18% setahun dengan penyusunan semula(restructure) atau menukar semua baki kad kredit terkumpul ke dalam Pelan Pembayaran Mudah(EPP).\n\n\nStop paying 18% p.a for your Credit Card Interest!Why paymore to the bank????\nDo you still continue paying 18% p.a credit card interest rate years after years?\nYou do not have sufficient cash on hand and not able to settle all your credit card outstanding balance in near future?\nThe good news is you have an option to stop paying these unnecessary interest of 18% p.a by restructuring all your credit card outstanding balance into our Easy Payment Plan(EPP).\n\n\n\n "}, {"ori_label": 31, "name": "Credit Card Roulette", "description": "1.

In 909 a see was established here with Edwulf as the first bishop.

It allows the cardholder to pay for goods and services based on the holder's promise to pay for them.

In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. A credit card also differs from a cash card, which can be used like currency by the owner of the card. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.The size of most credit cards is \u00d7 \u00a0in (85.60 \u00d7 53.98\u00a0mm), conforming to the ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 standard. Credit cards have a printed or embossed bank card number complying with the ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard. Both of these standards are maintained and further developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17/WG 1. Before magnetic stripe readers came into widespread use, plastic credit cards issued by many department stores were produced on stock (\"Princess\" or \"CR-50\") slightly longer and narrower than 7810. Some modern credit cards have a computer chip embedded in them for security reasons."}, {"ori_label": 52, "name": "IMVU Credits Hack Generator 2015", "description": "IMVU Credit Generator 2015 No Survey generate unlimited free credits and VIP easily in your account, this tool is working on Windows, Mac, Android iOS "}, {"ori_label": 52, "name": "Creditera", "description": "We believe business credit is too important to ignore.

Sir Edward was an owner of the original John Martins Department store, and Chairman of the John Martins Board.\n\nWith the blow from Sir Edward's whistle, the first Pageant began at 11am on Saturday 18 November 1933. There were just eight floats, and four bands, but to the people of South Australia, this was a wonderful and memorable occasion that lifted their spirits, and brought them much needed Christmas cheer.\n\nThe first Pageant ran for approximately 60 minutes, and attracted 200, 000 spectators. It was called the 'Children's Christmas Pageant 1933'. All of the Pageant characters were staff from the John Martins store, and the procession ran from Angas Street to John Martins Rundle Street. Some of the earliest Pageant costumes were made from crepe paper. Sir Edward was so delighted by the incredible success of the first Pageant, he and his team of organisers began to plan for the next one.\n\nFather Christmas appeared in the first Christmas Pageant, and since then has been escorted in grand style by the Pageant procession to the Magic Cave, an enchanting Christmas wonderland loved by both adults and children alike.\n\nDuring the unfortunate events of World War II in 1941, the joyous tradition of this annual event was interrupted and the floats were put under wraps. When the war ended, organisers worked quickly to stage the event again, eager to bring Christmas cheer and magic back to the community. In November 1945, the Pageant was resurrected and the Victory Pageant served its purpose to uplift community spirits, and bring back smiles to the faces of South Australians.\n\nIn 1983, just weeks before the Pageant's 50th year, the Golden Pageant, its creator Sir Edward Hayward passed away. Sir Edward lived to see the Pageant grow considerably since he first conceived the event, witnessing crowds, including a reported 500 000 spectators in 1969.\n\nThe State Bank of South Australia entered into partnership with John Martins to present the Pageant in 1984.\n\nWhen the Pageant celebrated its 60-years, the procession featured some 72 sets, with 1600 people taking part.\n\nBy 1995 David Jones had taken over ownership of John Martins and the Pageant. In this year David Jones sold the Pageant to the State Government of South Australia. The Pageant is now managed, produced and directed on behalf of the State Government by Events South Australia, the major events division of the South Australian Tourism Commission.\n\nThe State Government sought assistance from the South Australian business community to secure the future of this treasured event and in 1996 gained the long term commitment of leading South Australian credit unions as the naming rights sponsor of the event.\n\nThe first Credit Union Christmas Pageant was held in 1996 in its 64th year.\n\nThe partnership with the credit unions; Savings & Loans, Australian Central, Community CPS Australia, Credit Union SA and Police Credit Union continues to this day. Additional assistance is received from David Jones, Adelaide City Council, media partners and the many volunteers involved including the public, SA Police, State Emergency Services, Metropolitan Fire Services, SA Ambulance and St Johns Ambulance.\n\nThe Credit Union Christmas Pageant is a South Australian institution and recognised heritage icon that traditionally heralds the start of the Christmas season. From humble beginnings it has grown to be one of the largest and the best pageants of its kind in the world."}, {"ori_label": 52, "name": "America First Credit Union", "description": "America First Credit Union will provide you with financial products and services you need to manage your finances.\nVisit us at www.americafirst.com\nTwitter: @AFCU  Instagram: @americafirst\n\n\nPosting Guidelines:\n\nAmerica First Credit Union intends to provide a family-friendly atmosphere on all community, or open forum, platforms.

It had a population of 10,260 at the 2001 census.Port Credit was originally a settlement of the Mississauga Ojibwe first nations band and a trading post established in 1720 for the exchange of goods from the Europeans for furs trapped by the Mississaugas. After the War of 1812, a harbour was established by the Mississaugas together with European settlers. In 1847, the Mississaugas left the village to relocate on the Six Nations Reserve to be with other band members and first nations. Industry was established on the village periphery including an oil refinery, but the village is no longer a substantial industrial district. The village survived into the 20th century, becoming an independent municipality in 1909, until it was merged with the City of Mississauga in 1974.Today, the original core village is now a heritage conservation district. The harbour is mostly used for recreational boating.HistoryThe location of Port Credit was in the 1700s, the land of the Mississauga Ojibwe band. The location became used as a meeting place between the band and white traders, and the river was known to them as the Missinhe or \"trusting creek\".

It issued loans that helped create Switzerland's electrical grid and the European rail system. It also helped develop the country's currency system and funded entrepreneurship. In the 1900s Credit Suisse began shifting to retail banking in response to the elevation of the middle-class and the growing popularity of savings accounts. Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston in 1978. After a large failed loan put First Boston under financial stress, Credit Suisse bought a controlling share of the bank in 1988. In the 1990s, Credit Suisse acquired the Winterthur Group, Swiss Volksbank, Swiss American Securities Inc. (SASI) and Bank Leu among others. In the year 2000, it added the U.S. investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.The company restructured itself in 2002, 2004 and 2006.

Nearly 60 years ago (1951), Safeway Food Stores of Omaha was granted a charter to form a credit union designed to serve the financial needs of their employees. A short while later (1952), employees of the University of Nebraska Medical Center came upon a similar idea, that creating a credit union would provide both themselves and their co-workers with an alternative for value-priced financial services. With that, the University of Nebraska Medical Center Federal Credit Union was born.\n\nThese two separate institutions operated both individually and successfully for many years until 1982, when a decision by Safeway Food Store executives eliminated retail operations in Nebraska. The move left Safeway Omaha Employees Federal Credit Union with a weighty decision... How best to continue as a viable financial institution? The answer came in the form of a merger. And, in 1982 Safeway Omaha Employees FCU and the University of Nebraska Medical Center FCU joined forces to become one.\n\nAs a result of the merger, a new name (Metro Health Services Federal Credit Union) was selected for the newly formed institution. In that year, assets totaled $10 million with the credit union operating out of two small offices. As the credit union grew, so did the list of available member services, including the addition of mortgage lending products in 1987. Shortly thereafter (1988) the credit union opened a new Saddle Creek office which proved to be a launching pad for significant growth. New offices were added in '95, '01, '07 and '11 to bring the current total of branch offices to six.\n\nToday, with over 30,000 members, Metro Credit Union is the third largest credit union operating in Nebraska. Assets currently exceed $228 million and the list of available products and services rivals that of any area financial institution. Despite this growth, the goal of providing our members with value-priced financial services all delivered with friendly personal service has remained intact.\n\n\n"}, {"ori_label": 52, "name": "Credit Suisse Sports Awards", "description": "Der rote Teppich f\u00fcr die Hauptdarstellerinnen und Hauptdarsteller der Credit Suisse Sports Awards wird jedes Jahr Mitte Dezember ausgerollt.

Walter Hogan asked those coming from San Dionisio what activities were being undertaken by the group in their community. They responded that based on the Rover Scouts' doctrine, their activities revolved around service, love of God & love of country.\n\nThus, such community projects as artesian wells, playgrounds, basketball courts and cleanliness of environment were realized.\n\nFr. Hogan introduced the concept of Cooperatives which the group agreed with. One of the Rover Scouts who was also a member of an institutional cooperative, introduced the group to Fr. Gaston Duchesneau, a Jesuit priest who was then the director of the Institute of the Social Order (ISO).\n\nDr. Angel Mendoza, who was a barrio lieutenant at that time, called for an assembly to address the needs of the community, particularly the need for organizing a cooperative. Although many of those present agreed, there were also those who were against the concept because most of them were already old and thus not up to the task anymore. Mr. Jaime Ferrer, a strict disciplinarian, who was a leader of the Hunter\u2019s ROTC guerrillas in Para\u00f1aque and a colleague of Dr. Angel Mendoza in Club Tamorgo, boosted the morale of those who were interested.\n\nThere were forty five (45) participants who attended the seminar for nine (9) consecutive Fridays, only twenty eight (28) of whom were able to finish it. The speaker of the said seminar was Fr. Gaston Duchesneau, assisted by St. Andrew Asst. Parish Priest, Fr. Francis Witizelae.\n\nAt last, San Dionisio Cooperative Credit Union, Inc. (SDCCUI) was organized on July 28, 1961 by the twenty eight (28) founding members with three hundred eighty (P 380.00) pesos as starting capital. It was subsequently registered with the Cooperative Administration Office (CAO) on September 8, 1961.\n\nThe name San Dionisio Cooperative Credit Union, Inc. was named after the Patron Saint of Bgy. San Dionisio,   St. Dionysius .\n\nTHE FOUNDING MEMBERS\n\nAt first, the CAO was reluctant to register SDCCUI, because of the provision in the by-laws about minor depositors. It was also the first time ever that a community cooperative was organized. Later, however, the CAO agreed.\n\nOn October 4, 1973 San Dionisio Cooperative Credit Union Inc. was re-registered with the Bureau of Agricultural Cooperatives Development (BACOD). Later on, the cooperative was re-registered with the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) under R.A. 6938 and 6939 bearing the name San Dionisio Credit Cooperative (SDCC).\n\nOn October 16, 2009, SDCC was again registered with the CDA under R.A. 9520, also known as the Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008.\n\nIt may be worthwhile to note that with the help of the Varsitarians, a Para\u00f1aque civic club, the neighboring barangays of San Dionisio such as Tambo, Don Galo, Sto.Ni\u00f1o, La Huerta and Las Pi\u00f1as were motivated to organize their own cooperatives during the early 60\u2019s.\n\nTHE GROWING PROCESS\n\nWhen San Dionisio Credit Cooperative (SDCC) was formed, there were negative attitudes like: \u201cWalang humawak ng palayok na hindi naulingan ang kamay\u201d Nobody borrows from a cooperative; and the issue on credibility.\n\nHowever, SDCC was able to overcome those problems and challenges under the stewardship of Mr. Herminio C. Hernandez in his capacity as General Manager. In 1961, upon the request of the Board of Directors, he started with his voluntary service for 11 years up to 1972. He then gave up his well-paying job as an accountant in a shipping firm to work for the cooperative as its full-time General Manager, even with a lower compensation.\n\nThe following are the factors that contributed to the slow but sure growth of San Dionisio Credit Cooperative:\n\n1. Adherence to the Coop Philosophy and Principles\n2. Transparency of the officers and management\n3. Strong spirit of volunteerism\n4. Bottom-up principle\n\nAt present, San Dionisio Credit Cooperative is one of the oldest and most successful cooperatives in the Philippines, and is an outstanding example of a true-blooded cooperative that practices good governance thru its structure, systems, policies and programs. It is a cooperative that is committed to serve its members and community with integrity."}, {"ori_label": 52, "name": "Credit Financier Invest - Trade | With | Confidence", "description": "Founded by a team with experience which dates back to the 1950s, CFI is optimally banks on the insight this legacy provides.

It was active in investment banking, capital markets and financial services.In 2006, as part of a major rebranding exercise to communicate as an integrated organization - 'Credit Suisse' to clients, employees and shareholders; the group retired the 'First Boston' name and amalgamated the CSFB operations to the newly reorganized investment banking division of Credit Suisse.HistoryCredit Suisse/First Boston 50/50 JV (1978\u20131988)In 1978, Credit Suisse and First Boston Corporation formed a London-based 50-50 investment banking joint venture called the Financi\u00e8re Cr\u00e9dit Suisse-First Boston. This joint venture later became the operating name of Credit Suisse's investment banking operations.Transition to CSFB (1988\u20131997)Credit Suisse acquired a 44% stake in First Boston in 1988. The investment bank acquired its shares held by the public and the company was taken private. In 1989, the junk bond market collapsed, leaving First Boston unable to redeem hundreds of millions it had lent for the leveraged buyout of Ohio Mattress Company, maker of Sealy mattresses, a deal that became known as \"the burning bed\". Credit Suisse bailed them out and acquired a controlling stake in 1990. Although such an arrangement was arguably illegal under the Glass\u2013Steagall Act, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. bank regulator, concluded that the integrity of the financial markets was better served by avoiding the bankruptcy of a significant investment bank like First Boston even though it meant a de facto merger of a commercial bank with an investment bank."}, {"ori_label": 52, "name": "Kamuna Credit Co-operative Society Limited", "description": "Kamuna Credit Co-operative Society is formed by its founding members and is currently operational in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Maharashtra.

According to the Federal Trade Commission an estimated 10 million consumers have erroneous (false/wrong) information on their personal credit file. According to Credit Report.com \"Studies show that a high percentage of consumer credit reports - up to 70 percent - contain errors\".  Most people will not even look at their credit report until it is too late and they have already applied/been denied for credit. Be proactive in knowing the information on your report so you know before you apply for credit that all the information is correct. Just by doing that one can save thousands of dollars that would be paid in higher interest rates.\n\nCleaning up your credit report is a gradual process. It involves disputing erroneous information in your personal credit file. Some can have results in as few as days but most will take 30 days to return the results of an investigation. If the agency reporting information on your credit report does not reply to the Credit Reporting Agency's request to verify the account it has to be deleted. If the investigation verifies that the information is yours, and you have proof that it is definitively not yours,one can seek the expertise of a consumer lawyer to take legal action against the agency reporting erroneous information and causing harm to your good name.\n\nhttp://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/\n"}, {"ori_label": 52, "name": "American Heritage Federal Credit Union", "description": "American Heritage Federal Credit Union is a $1.4 billion member-owned financial cooperative serving over 700 sponsor companies.

We are your neighbors, your friends and your family. We are T-ball coaches, shoelace tiers, car pool drivers\u2026and your financial partner. We are also teachers. In fact, each one of us is a teacher in his or her own way. And while we may not be in a conventional classroom setting, we all teach, learn and share everyday life moments--whether it is with family, friends or co-workers. We are all teachers, with life lessons to share, and opportunities to learn.\n\nOur History\nAlabama Teachers Credit Union was organized in March 1959 with just two employees, and was located on the second floor of the Gadsden City Board of Education Building. Previously known as Etowah Teachers Credit Union, our original Select Employee Group (SEG) was only open to employees and family members of the Gadsden City and Etowah County School Systems.\n\nIn 1982, the credit union moved to a new location on 6th Street in downtown Gadsden. Six years later, in August 1989, the credit union received approval from the Alabama Credit Union Administration (ACUA) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to convert from a federal charter to a state charter, which allowed the credit union to change its name from Etowah Teachers to Alabama Teachers Credit Union. In July 2001, Alabama Teachers received further permission from the ACUA to expand its membership to include anyone residing, working, or attending school in the five counties we serve: Calhoun, Cherokee, DeKalb, Etowah, and Marshall.\n\nToday\nTo embrace our field of membership and our strong name simultaneously, we recognized that teachers weren't just limited to educating in the traditional classroom setting, but that the act itself applied to each one of us. Therefore, in July of 2012, Alabama Teachers Credit Union introduced a new brand and image--we are all teachers--because we believe in being a student of life.\n\nIt is by our brand that we celebrate every teaching moment in life and we understand that by learning together, we enhance not only ourselves, but also each other. The enthusiasm of our credit union, members, and community has led to a continued strengthening of our membership numbers, assets, and overall financial stability.\n\nOur Values\nAlabama Teachers is a not-for-profit financial institution that provides safe, affordable and convenient financial services to its members. Because we are a cooperative, all our members are part owners of the credit union and have the right to democratically elect the Board of Directors, a group of volunteers who helps guide the credit union's progress. The Board of Directors sets policy and ensures the highest standard of financial services to our members.\n\nAlabama Teachers highly values its members and is committed to providing them with competitive rates and terms, excellent member service, resourceful financial tools, and the opportunity to learn from one another. These principles play an integral part in the mission statement of Alabama Teachers.\n\nOur Mission Statement\nAlabama Teachers is a family of caring individuals dedicated to strengthening lives through financial partnerships. It is this firm commitment that allows us to embrace the teaching moments of life, because through them we can all learn together.\n\nThe Credit Union Difference\nWhile services from a credit union such as Alabama Teachers may appear nearly the same as a bank, the structure and philosophy are very different.\n\nNot-for-profit--Like all credit unions, Alabama Teachers is a not-for-profit financial cooperative. Unlike most other financial institutions, credit unions do not issue stock or pay dividends to outside stockholders. Instead, earnings are returned to our members in the form of lower loan rates, higher interest on deposits, and lower fees.\n\nTaxation--Credit unions pay taxes: payroll taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes. But Congress exempts credit unions from federal income taxes. According to the Credit Union Membership Access Act, \"\u2026 credit unions are member-owned, democratically operated, not-for-profit organizations generally managed by volunteer boards of directors and they have the specified mission of meeting the credit and savings needs of consumers, especially persons of modest means.\" \n\nOwnership--Each member has equal ownership and one vote--regardless of how much money a member has on deposit. \nVolunteer Boards--Alabama Teachers is governed by a board of directors, elected by and from the credit union's membership and serve voluntarily.\n\nMembership Eligibility--By current federal statute, credit unions such as Alabama Teachers cannot serve the general public. People qualify for a credit union membership through their employer, organizational affiliations like churches or social groups, or a community-chartered credit union.\nFinancial Education for Members--Alabama Teachers is dedicated to helping members become better-educated consumers of financial services. \n\nSocial Purpose: People Helping People--Credit unions exist to help people, not make a profit. Alabama Teachers' goal is to serve its members, neighbors, and communities to further enrich their financial health and overall well-being. As a member, we welcome the opportunity to help you with your everyday life goals as we all learn together."}, {"ori_label": 52, "name": "CINCO Credit Union", "description": "Our friendly and knowledgeable staff are people you know, you like, and you trust.

The primary goal of corporate finance is to maximize or increase shareholder value. Although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms, rather than corporations alone, the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms.Investment analysis (or capital budgeting) is concerned with the setting of criteria about which value-adding projects should receive investment funding, and whether to finance that investment with equity or debt capital. Working capital management is the management of the company's monetary funds that deal with the short-term operating balance of current assets and current liabilities; the focus here is on managing cash, inventories, and short-term borrowing and lending (such as the terms on credit extended to customers)."}, {"ori_label": 53, "name": "Just Cars Finance", "description": "Whether you are a private buyer, a business owner or buying your new car as part of a salary sacrifice it pays to have a specialist that can assist you with your car finance.

It is the branch of economics which assesses the government revenue and government expenditure of the public authorities and the adjustment of one or the other to achieve desirable effects and avoid undesirable ones.The purview of public finance is considered to be threefold: governmental effects on (1) efficient allocation of resources, (2) distribution of income, and (3) macroeconomic stabilization.OverviewThe proper role of government provides a starting point for the analysis of public finance. In theory, under certain circumstances, private markets will allocate goods and services among individuals efficiently (in the sense that no waste occurs and that individual tastes are matching with the economy's productive abilities). If private markets were able to provide efficient outcomes and if the distribution of income were socially acceptable, then there would be little or no scope for government. In many cases, however, conditions for private market efficiency are violated. For example, if many people can enjoy the same good at the same time (non-rival, non-excludable consumption), then private markets may supply too little of that good. National defense is one example of non-rival consumption, or of a public good.\"Market failure\" occurs when private markets do not allocate goods or services efficiently. The existence of market failure provides an efficiency-based rationale for collective or governmental provision of goods and services. Externalities, public goods, informational advantages, strong economies of scale, and network effects can cause market failures. Public provision via a government or a voluntary association, however, is subject to other inefficiencies, termed \"government failure.\""}, {"ori_label": 53, "name": "Electronica Finance Ltd", "description": "EFL is Non-Banking Finance Company (NBFC) and engaged in MSME Finance in India.

Nandakumar, the Chairman of the Group.\nManappuram's origins go back to 1949 when it was founded in Valapad (a coastal village in the Thrissur District of Kerala) by the late V.C. Padmanabhan, father of Shri Nandakumar. Its activity was mainly pawn broking and money lending carried out on a modest scale. The principal asset of the company was the integrity and foresight of its Founder and among the people of the area it soon acquired a reputation as a safe-haven for their investments.\n\nThe expansion: Shri Nandakumar took over the reins of this one Branch business in the year 1986 when his father expired. Since then, it has been a story of unparalleled growth, with new milestones being crossed every year. And today, it has grown into the Manappuram Group with nine companies in its fold having diverse interests in Gold Loans, Asset Financing, Insurance, Foreign Exchange, Money Changing, and most recently, retail gold jewellery and affordable Healthcare. The group's flagship, Manappuram Finance Ltd. (MAFIL), is India's first listed, highest credit rated gold loan company and widely recognised as one of leading wealth creators in the Indian stock market in recent times. Incidentally, all the group companies including MAFIL continue to be head-quartered at Valapad.\n\nManappuram Finance Ltd. is now recognised as a leading national player in its core activity of gold loans. Established in the year 1992 (the original name was Manappuram General Finance and Leasing Limited), the company has since maintained a consistently rapid pace of growth. Today, it has over 2,500 branches across 22 states with Assets under Management (AUM) exceeding Rs.10,000 crores, a workforce of about 18,000 and a live customer base of 12 lakhs.\n\nThe many achievements: Soon after it commenced its operations, Manappuram Finance gathered several \"firsts\" to its credit. The company was the First NBFC in Kerala to receive a Certificate of Registration issued by the RBI. It was the first Kerala based NBFC to get a Credit Rating in 1995 of \"MA\" (current rating MA+) from ICRA, recognising the company's ability to make timely repayments of the principal and interest under its Public Deposit Programme. Manappuram Finance was one of the very first NBFCs from Kerala to go for a Public Issue of its shares in 1995. In fact, the company has been consistently making profits and paying dividends from the very first full year of operations.\n\nThe company was also the first NBFC from Kerala to issue bonus shares in the ratio of 1:1 in 2007 and then, repeat the feat twice, in 2010 and in 2011 (making it three such instances in five years). Moreover, in 2007, MAFIL became the first Kerala based NBFC to receive foreign Investment from FIIs, and also get the highest short term credit rating of A1+ from ICRA. In 2010, it became the very first Kerala-based company to offer ESOPs (Employee Stock Option Plan) to its middle and senior management functionaries. In April 2011, it became only the second listed company from Kerala to have its shares traded in the \"A-Group\" at the Bombay stock exchange.\n\nOther activities: As part of its diversification, Manappuram Finance has also ventured into the Foreign Exchange business with the Reserve Bank of India giving the company an Authorised Dealer - II licence which permits it to effect outward remittances for a variety of purposes such as overseas medical treatment, higher education abroad, business travel, conferences etc. The Company has commenced Instant Money Transfer in collaboration with UAE Xchange, Wallstreet and MoneyGram.\n\nHuman Resources: As an organization that prides itself as a pioneer and innovator, MAFIL derives its strength from the dedication of its highly motivated staff. Right from inception, the company has been keen to spot the best available talent. The HR department of the company places emphasis on professionalism and in honing the skills of employees to maintain the edge in a competitive world. The company has a full-fledged training establishment where in-house training courses are regularly conducted in a professional manner to upgrade skills and to enhance functional efficiency. Moreover, the company sponsors an MBA degree programme for its employees who have completed five years of service keen to upgrade their professional skills and qualifications.\n\nThe vision: In the next four to give years, MAFIL hopes to emerge as the largest player in the gold loan sector in India. The Company also hopes to expand its footprint to a global level in due course. The long term vision of the company is to unlock the value of India's large stock of privately held gold (estimated at about 18,000 tonnes) to the benefit of the common people of India, most of whom possess savings in the form of gold jewellery.

The task of customs revenue collection was given to the private sector on contract since the institutional base was weak and fragmented at that time. However the modern era of customs begins with the trade treaty with India in 1950. As a result, inner customs offices were closed and borders offices started to work as customs offices. After 1950, Tariff Board used to determine customs rates in accordance of which tariffs used to be levied. In 1956, all bazaar addas (border offices) were turned into customs offices.

It is a story about the desire to build a home for every Filipino. To deservedly reward the hard work and perseverance of the Filipino family man. To give young families a place of their own where they can grow their dreams and tomorrows. To create communities where residents feel safe and feel they belong to.\n\nIt is also a story of evolution \u2013 from building some of the country\u2019s finest and most desired communities to today, building cities.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the master plan. In real estate parlance, the \u201cmaster plan\u201d is a comprehensive plan that guides the long-term physical development of a particular area. The Camella masterplans describe residential communities that are more than a composite of homes, streets, parks, and playgrounds. Camella believes that communities should bring whatever its families need within easy reach. Thus, each community is ideally located with immediate access to crucial institutions like schools, hospitals, churches, transport hubs, and places of leisure. They are close to business centers, so work is easy to get to, and come home from. But the group has taken this a step further and exploded that strategy by bringing the institutions right into the communities. Now, when Camella builds, it also builds churches, schools and commercial centers. By creating properties that are essentially self-contained, it is creating virtual cities.\n\nTo Camella, the master plan of every single community it builds, in every single location it selects, is a sacred, living blueprint that incorporates not only what the group intends to build, but what it intends to accomplish \u00ac\u2013 it intends to build cities; and since a country is often known by its cities \u2013 France is Paris. Japan is Tokyo. England is London. The USA is New York, Los Angeles and Miami \u00ac\u2013 by building communities where they are needed, and by creating the foundations for tomorrow\u2019s cities, Camella is building the country.\n\nBeyond creating practically self-contained communities, Camella developments have become a \u201cmark of progress\u201d across the country. Camella developments often portent movement into the town, city or province they come to \u2013 they portent growth and expansion. What was once quiet and sleepy becomes bustling and dynamic. Roads get better, commercial developments crop up, utilities are upgraded, transport increases, and possibilities become endless. Lives improve, dreams become bigger, needs diversify, expectations expand, and growth becomes inevitable.\n\nThroughout history, this is exactly how the great cities of the world came to be. A germ, a seed, set growth in motion. A few homes built along a river evolve into a great city. A tiny market along a roadway becomes a town that becomes a metropolis. A community is designed for the future and built to respond to what is needed today, and what will be needed to tomorrow \u00ac\u2013 and slowly, and surely, a country will be built better.\n\n\u201cCamella. Building the Country,\u201d speaks of more than what the brand is all about, it speaks of what the brand promises to do."}, {"ori_label": 22, "name": "Mackay House and Land Sales", "description": "You know it when you see it ....\nThe perfect block of land for the perfect home ...\nFor the home of your dreams or the dream investment ...\nAnd the place to look is Mackay Land Sales ...\nWith a few estates to choose from ....\nFrom Budget to Prestige .....\nA visit to MackayLandSales.com.au can save you time, money and hassles ...\nYou see more land and options, so you'll see the block that is right for you, sooner .....\nMackayLandSales.com.au \n\nIt's all about choice ....\n"}, {"ori_label": 22, "name": "CoachHouse Medical Ltd - Ultherapy UK Sales Agent", "description": "What is Ultherapy?\n\nUltherapy is a non-surgical, non-invasive procedure that uses focused, targeted ultrasound and the body's own natural healing process to lift and tone loose skin on the brow, neck, under then chin and now the d\u00e9colletage.\n\nPatient Benefits:\nThe ONLY FDA-cleared, non-invasive ultrasound lifting treatment\n3 FDA-Clearances\n300,000 treatments worldwide to date\nLong lasting effects\nNo downtime after treatment.\n\nFind us on Twitter @UltherapyUK"}, {"ori_label": 22, "name": "House's Auto Sales", "description": "Used Car and Truck Dealer"}, {"ori_label": 22, "name": "Apartment/House for Rent, for Sale, Philippines", "description": "We have Apartment/House Units for Sale and with units ready for rent.

The house was bought by Judge Corwin in 1675, when he was 24 years old, and he lived there for more than forty years. Corwin is buried in the nearby Broad Street Cemetery. The house remained in the Corwin family until the mid-19th century. The Witch House is located at 310 Essex Street, at the cross streets of North & Summer in the Chestnut Street District of Salem.As a local magistrate and civic leader, Corwin was called upon to investigate the claims of diabolical activity when a surge of witchcraft accusations arose in Salem and neighboring communities. He took the place of Judge Nathaniel Saltonstall, who resigned after the execution of Bridget Bishop. Corwin served on the Court of Oyer and Terminer, which ultimately sent nineteen to the gallows. All nineteen refused to admit to witchcraft and maintained their innocence.The house is an excellent example of 17th-century architecture. To this day historians have not come to a conclusion as to when it was built. Jonathan Corwin's descendants claim the house was built in 1642. Some Victorian scholars alleged that the house was built between 1620\u20131630, and that Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island resided in the house in the 1630s. However most historians now believe the house was built in the 1660s or 1670s. It bears a strong resemblance to the Whitehall building in Sutton, England, a historic home museum built around 1500."}, {"ori_label": 22, "name": "\u91d1\u660e\u8eca\u696d JinMing Scooter Sales & Service", "description": "Kymco/Yamaha/Sym \u5168\u8eca\u7cfb\u8cb7\u8ce3\u5c08\u696d\u7dad\u4fee\u4fdd\u990a\n\n\n\u592a\u53e4\u7e3d\u4ee3\u7406VESPA\u6843\u5712\u5e02\u7d93\u92b7\u8655 VESPA\u5168\u8eca\u7cfb\u8cb7\u8ce3\u5c08\u696d\u7dad\u4fee\u4fdd\u990a\n\n\nVESPA ET8\u8eca\u7cfb \u5c08\u696d\u7dad\u4fee\u4fdd\u990a \u5168\u8eca\u7cbe\u7dfb\u62c6\u88dd\u70e4\u6f06 \u5927\u6574(\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u56fa\u670d\u52d9)\n\n\n\u5049\u58eb\u8eca\u7cfb\u5404\u9805\u7cbe\u54c1 \u52d5\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u90e8\u54c1\u5957\u4ef6 \u6b61\u8fce\u6d3d\u8a62\n\n\n\u50f9\u683c\u516c\u9053 \u6280\u8853\u5230\u4f4d  \u6b61\u8fce\u8eca\u53cb\u524d\u4f86\u53c3\u89c0\u6307\u5c0e\n"}, {"ori_label": 22, "name": "The Close & Cencarik Group", "description": "With 20 years of sale experience The Close & Cencarik Group provide all real estate services in a \"Boutique\" atmosphere.

The whole area is 4531 sqm). Both lots have clean papers with one owner, which makes a transfer of ownership safe and easy for the buyer.\n\nThe two large lots were surveyed to divide them into 10 subdivision lots plus road. This surveyplan is now for approval and then ready for further processing at the Registry of Deeds, if required. So the land may be used in one piece or it may be divided into 10 subdivision lots with their own titles. How many of these sudivision lots later will be combined to single properties may be handled flexible, e.g. Lots 9 and 10 now are meant to be used together for the house with garden while number 5 with the unfinished house under construction can be used o lot number 5 only as well as in combination with lots number 4 and/or number 6.\n\nThe finished house is on lot number 10 with a garden and swimmingpool on lot\nnumber 9. Both lots together have an area of 991 sqm. The house has a large livingroom with kitchen, a bedroom downstairs, two bathrooms, a very large room upstairs, two terraces, carport and stockroom. The total living area indoor is aproximately 140 sqm and including terraces approximately 185 sqm plus carport.\n\nDistances:\nGeneral Hospital 10 min\nDowntown Area 10 min\nSeaside 1 min\nShopping Mall 10 min\nPolice Station 5 min\nFire Station 10 min\nDomestic Airport 20 min "}, {"ori_label": 22, "name": "House and Lot for Sale: Queenstown Heights 2", "description": "Ready for Occupancy at 10% Downpayment,....

Rent.ph would like to make it easier for owners and renters to connect with each other or with the assistance of real estate experts to enable the rental process shorter, more professionalized, personalized and transparent for both lessees and lessors.\n\nBacked by 2,000 real estate professionals officially affiliated with Rent.ph (and growing) spread across the country, owners can look for the nearest Rent Manager or agent where the property is located to help him market the property to prospects. Renters in search of properties can also seek the services of a Rent Manager or agent near him thus, reducing the effort and search time of renters and owners considerably.\n\nUnique also to the site are rental listings in the hospitality sector to address the search for transient or short-staying renters. We have included listings for hotels, apartelles and inns and other similar accommodations. Homestay listings are also underway as part of our effort to promote tourism in the country thus, the site is getting exciting-er every day.\n\nWith hundreds of listings posted everyday, and growing number of unique visitors daily, the site is also an effective advertising platform for property and rent-related products and services like furniture and home furnishings, logistics and moving-in services, cable, telecom, insurance and a host of other services in home living.\n\nTargeted advertising forms part of the core services in Rent.'s search algorithm.

Our mission is to establish the most innovative technology platform and best user-experience that bring renters, owners and property professionals together to make the property rental business more efficient, reliable and trustworthy.\n\n\tFirst in Features\nRent.ph is committed to bring the best technology to its users. It is the first property rental site that combines rental listing with rich media tools such as video embedding services which allows users to upload not only images, but also to display videos of their properties.\n\nIt is also the first property rental site in the world to integrate the QR Code system. A listed property property at Rent.ph is assigned a unique QR Code which can be printed out or circulated by email or shared in social networks. The QR code is specially useful to property owners when they need to advertise their property outdoors.\n\nLeveraging Google's map widget, Rent.ph is address-sensitive which accurately locates a property down to its street and barangay address.\n\nWe have also put up the nationwide weather guide to help renters decide the best time of day and week to move. Rent.ph's weather feature is location-sensitive. Whenever a renter searches a property in a particular province, forecast changes according to the weather in that area.\n\nAnother \"first\" in Rent.ph is its short messaging service where prospects can send text messages from the site to the property owner or agent's mobile phone.\n\nWe strive to be the first in everything both in technology and information resource to bring best rental experience to all Filipinos and expatriates.\n\nas seen on:\n-philstar.com\n-sunstar cebu\n-the freeman\n-philippine daily inquirer\n-business owrld online\n-expat newspaper\n-cebu daily news"}, {"ori_label": 22, "name": "HOUSE for Sale FIJI Expressions of Interest", "description": "Due to changes in family matters it has become necessary to sell our Fiji home.

Buying your travel insurance policy from an aggregator gives you a full slate of options, so you know that you are getting the right policy for you. We make the process of connecting you with an appropriate plan that fits your needs quickly, easily, and above all, comprehensibly.\n\nNo one has as much experience as us when it comes to travel insurance. Those who have any industry experience tend to be general, closed market providers who have less of an incentive to care for you after the point of sale, while we are here 24/7 when you have specific questions regarding a policy or any issues with your claim. All policies purchased through G1G come with 24/7 emergency assistance so you are never left alone during a crisis abroad.

G1G set an industry standard over a decade ago by requiring all providers to have an A.M. Best rating of no lower than an A. Building on that foundation, we have since elevated our quality assurance to include an analysis of a company's BBB report, customer reviews, claims pay-out ratio, reinsurers credit history, and other benchmarks that assist in connecting you with only the best products in the world. This often means making the decision of not offering products and underwriters that fall below our standard.\n\nOur industry experience combined with personal travel experience allows us to implement new ideas with the perspective of the user in mind. We are the only aggregator in the world to provide a fully branded client portal, giving you access to all your necessities in one place. We have made G1G.com accessible around the world \u2013 available through your personal computer, tablet, or phone, connecting you to real humans.\n\nAdditionally, we work with underwriters and third party administrators to create new products for travelers, and on a business-to-business level, allowing affiliates to resell our products and services to their users.

Investment has a different meaning in finance from that in economics.In finance, investment is buying or creating an asset with the expectation of capital appreciation, dividends (profit), interest earnings, rents, or some combination of these returns. This may or may not be backed by research and analysis. Most or all forms of investment involve some form of risk, such as investment in equities, property, and even fixed interest securities which are subject, among other things, to inflation risk. It is indispensable for project investors to identify and manage the risks related to the investment.OverviewIn finance, investment is the purchase of an asset or item with the hope that it will generate income or appreciate in the future and be sold at the higher price. It generally does not include deposits with a bank or similar institution. The term investment is usually used when referring to a long-term outlook. This is the opposite of trading or speculation, which are short-term practices involving a much higher degree of risk. Financial assets take many forms and can range from the ultra safe low return government bonds to much higher risk higher reward international stocks.

"}, {"ori_label": 41, "name": "Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority -CIAA", "description": "The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) is a constitutional body created by the Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007, Part 11, Article 119. Its members are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council. Article 120 of the constitution empowers this commission to investigate and enquire upon cases of improper conduct or corruption by any public official and to recommend that departmental action or judicial proceedings be taken against persons deemed guilty of such offences. \n\nThe origin of this institution can be traced back to the time when the previous Constitution of 1990 was in effect. The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act enacted in 1991 had granted the Commission further responsibility to - point out the existing flaws in the prevailing laws and order concerned authorities to make amends for the harm caused by such flaws, extract fines for abuse of authority, hold the accused under judicial custody to be released under conditions of bail, create awareness raising programmes, cooperate with non-governmental and international organizations working against corruption, make use of specialized knowledge in related fields. \n\nThe policy behind the creation of such authority appears to be clear. It is to achieve transparency in governance by taking action on corrupt behaviour of public officials. It is important to note that transparency in the conduct of the Commission itself is a key factor in its success. Appointment of the members of the Commission is the first step towards realizing its goals. Therefore the Interim Constitution in Article 119(5) stresses on the impartiality and prudence of the Commission by prescribing that the Chief Commissioner or the Commissioner has to be someone with sound educational qualification, without any affiliation to any political party, having minimum 20 years of experience in the field of accounting revenue, engineering, law, development or research, being atleast forty five years of age possessing a high moral character. The Commission can initiate proceedings either in case of a complaint or can take suo motu action as well. \n\nHowever, the success of the CIAA is closely related to the interpretation rendered by the courts and other judicial authorities. No anti-corruption policy can succeed without proper cooperation from the courts of law which themselves are not free of corruption. It should be noted that the CIAA is empowered to investigate upon Judges that are removed by the Judicial Council for abuse of authority. \n\nThe CIAA is also mandated to submit an annual report to the President who will present the report to the Legislature via the Prime Minister. Besides the Interim Constitution, the CIAA currently has to work in accordance with the following legislations - the CIAA Act 1991, The Prevention of Corruption Act 2002, the CIAA rules 2002, the CIAA Action Plan 2007, Code of Conduct for CIAA commissioners and staff, 2008, Anti-Corruption Committee action plan, 2008. The Commission thus had a wide range of constitutional and legislative authority behind it.

Amidst volatility and gloom, with many investors pulling money out of Asia following market turmoil in early 2015 and a general flight from emerging markets, there are still many reasons to be optimistic. Economic reform is abound, as China is embarking on a significant programme of reforming and deregulating its economy and financial markets, while India and Indonesia seem poised to enact changes following electoral victories by their respective leaders. Will deal-making continue to flourish amidst a backdrop of healthy corporates and political headwinds? How will markets in Asia perform amidst diverging economic pictures? And will a Chinese slowdown disrupt Asian financial markets?\n\n\nInitiated by students from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), the Asia Investment Banking Conference (AIBC) is the largest student-run conference in Asia focused on corporate advisory and financial markets. Held for the 7th year running, the conference continues to attract more than 300 of the brightest and most talented students from approximately 50 renowned universities across the globe each year. As Asian financial markets evolve and become more dynamic, this year's conference will comprise keynote speeches, panel discussions, workshops and interactive learning sessions featuring senior professionals within the industry.\n\nParticipate in our competitions and stand a chance to be fast-tracked to the 2016/17 Summer Internship with Credit Suisse in Hong Kong or Singapore!"}, {"ori_label": 41, "name": "BIG Investment Group LLC", "description": "BIG Investment Group LLC Disclaimer\n\nPenny Stock Disclosure/DisclaimerThis Disclosure/Disclaimer must be read and fully understood before using this website or any affiliated or related websites, Facebook pages, twitter page, message boards or joining our e-mail list.\n\nRelease of Liability: Through use of this website viewing or using you agree to hold, its operators, owners BIG Investment Group LLC and any affiliates, officers, directors, employees or related person(s) harmless and to completely release them from any and all liability due to any and all loss (monetary or otherwise), damage (monetary or otherwise), or injury (monetary or otherwise) that you may incur.

He explained the change as:Mr. MarketGraham's favorite allegory is that of Mr. Market, an obliging fellow who turns up every day at the shareholder's door offering to buy or sell his shares at a different price. Often, the price quoted by Mr. Market seems plausible, but sometimes it is ridiculous. The investor is free to either agree with his quoted price and trade with him, or ignore him completely. Mr. Market doesn't mind this, and will be back the following day to quote another price.The point of this anecdote is that the investor should not regard the whims of Mr. Market as a determining factor in the value of the shares the investor owns. He should profit from market folly rather than participate in it. The investor is advised to concentrate on the real life performance of his companies and receiving dividends, rather than be too concerned with Mr. Market's often irrational behavior.EditionsSince the work was published in 1949 Graham revised it several times, most recently in 1971\u201372. This was published in 1973 as the \"Fourth Revised Edition\" ISBN 0-06-015547-7, and it included a preface and appendices by Warren Buffett. Graham died in 1976. Commentaries and new footnotes were added to the fourth edition by Jason Zweig, and this new revision was published in 2003."}, {"ori_label": 41, "name": "Invested By Far", "description": "Invested By Far\nAQHA/APHA/PtHA Palomino Overo Stallion\nWorld Champion - World Champion Sire\n15.3 hands ~ 1250 lbs\nGenetic 5 Panel N/N\nDoes not have Impressive in his lineage making him the perfect Outcross as he adds Hybrid Vigor! \n\nAs a Frame Overo he carries 1 copy of the Overo gene (OLWS n/O) which is responsible for his coat pattern. Breeding two carriers of this gene may result in a lethal white foal. All mares with Overo lineage must test OLWS N/N to be bred to our stallion to avoid his producing a lethal foal. Otherwise the OLWS gene does not affect a horse. It does not cause tying up or seizures, the skin to fall off, possible death when being sedated, or foals to abort. Hence it is not part of the 5 panel test. \n\nWe offer a Live Foal Guarantee but do not offer a Live Color Foal Guarantee. There are many reasons for this.\n1.)IBF is AQHA papered and all AQHA/TB mares bred to him can be registered in AQHA.  \n2.) SPB horses can still be shown in APHA & PtHA as well as be used in breeding programs\n3.) The get may carry the gene but not express it through coat pattern. \n4.) IBF has only sired 2 SPB/AQHA foals that were sorrel. The rest were Dun or Palomino. He has currently sired 83% Overo and 68% non-red foals on all AQHA mares bred. 32% of these were red based and of those only two were solid. He is siring better than average pertaining to both color and pattern as genetically speaking you have a 50/50 shot at either. \n5.) We are not in the business of giving away breedings for lack of a spot. If breeding strictly for color look for a homozygous tobiano stallion. \n6.) We spend a small fortune to make our stallion eligible for as many programs as possible and having a SPB does not keep you from showing in associations such as NSBA, PHBA, ABRA, IBHA, AQHA, PtHA, or APHA. \n7.) You will still have a top quality foal - IBF foals are not defined by their color but by their minds, beauty, and ability! Color is the bonus; quality if the goal! \n\nWe offer an early booking discount through the end of December. Afterward only our multi mare and proven mare discounts will remain in affect. These discounts are as follows:\n\nWorld & Res World Champion mares or producers of the same do not pay a stud fee and only pay collection/shipping/vet fees. Show record must be provided. \n\nSuperior earning mares or producers of the same get $150 off. \n\nROM earners/producers qualify for $100 off. \n\nMulti mare discounts - $100 off for each additional mare booked. \n\nThe booking fee is a non-refundable fee which is included in the stud fee and is therefore deducted from the overall stud fee. This fee holds a breeding for your mare (mares). Once the book is full no more mares will be accepted for that breeding season. \n\nWe work with many of our customers by allowing payments as they can afford to pay them.

See the prospectus for details.\n\nInternational investing involves certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, economic instability, and political developments. Additional risks may be associated with emerging-market securities, including illiquidity and volatility. Growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments, and value stocks may fail to rebound. Funds that invest in bonds are subject to certain risks including interest-rate risk, credit risk, and inflation risk. As interest rates rise, the prices of bonds fall. Long-term bonds are more exposed to interest-rate risk than short-term bonds. Unlike bonds, funds that invest in bonds have ongoing fees and expenses. Lower-rated bonds may offer higher yields in return for more risk.\n\nRequest a prospectus, a summary prospectus if available, or an offering statement from your financial representative or by calling Putnam at 1-800-225-1581.

Anyone may invest in the plan and use the proceeds to attend school in any state. Before investing, consider whether your state's plan or that of your beneficiary offers state tax and other benefits not available through Putnam 529 for America.

The large influx of tourists has been boosted tremendously by the Indonesian government's pledge to pour billions in investment to capitalize on the natural beauty and attractions that Lombok has to provide and is poised to surpass Bali as the main attraction that Indonesia has to offer. \n\nTrue to its promise, the government has constructed a new International Airport paving the way for more flight arrivals both domestically and internationally. Leading the way is Silkair who have increased flights directly from Singapore to 5 times a week with Tiger Airways launching this route in November 2013. Air Asia and Jetstar have not overlooked this attractive route and provide direct flights from Kuala Lumpur and Perth respectively. \n\nWith visitor arrivals set to grow exponentially, Lombok is in its infant stages of an economic boom that is set to take Asia by storm and a linear growth is hugely expected from the real estate and property sector. \n\nCurrently rated by Lonely Planet as \"one of the world's best destination to visit\" and boasting one of the world's best surf and dive points, well known as Desert Point the island already possesses a reputation amongst many globally. The untouched beauty beneath Lombok's clear waters boasts an aqua life comprising of live corals and sea life that compares to that of the Maldives. Mout Rinjani, Indonesia's second highest volcano sits in awe in Lombok as trekkers experience the sunset. With so much already to offer, its no wonder Indonesia has taken special interest in this island to be its next tourism cash cow. \n\nWork is already underway in the development of the Mandalika project spanning over 1000 hectares of land on an Integrated Resort to match that of what Singapore has to offer and much headway has been made in groundbreaking news that the Formula One will be hosted in Lombok in the near future. \n\nInvest in Lombok provides a platform for you to take part in this tourism and economic boom and look into a market that is set to grow your wealth and asset portfolio while the opportunity still exists. Property prices in sister island Bali were a fraction of what they were 10 - 15 years ago and if you've missed that opportunity, speak to us today on how you can be part of an era of growth"}, {"ori_label": 41, "name": "AFIR - Agen\u021bia pentru Finan\u021barea Investi\u021biilor Rurale", "description": "Agen\u021bia pentru Finan\u021barea Investi\u021biilor Rurale este institu\u021bia public\u0103, subordonat\u0103 Ministerului Agriculturii \u0219i Dezvolt\u0103rii Rurale, care asigur\u0103 implementarea tehnic\u0103 \u0219i financiar\u0103 a Programului Na\u021bional de Dezvoltare Rural\u0103.

Its history retroacts to 13 November 1936, when a Division of Investigation (DI) under the Department of Justice was created with the enactment of Commonwealth Act No. 181 by the First National Assembly. Sec. 1, C.A. No. 181 provides:\"'A Division of Investigation under the Department of Justice is hereby created. It shall be composed of such personnel as may be necessary, in the discretion of the Secretary of Justice, and its duties shall be to help in the detection and prosecution of crimes; to acquire, collect, classify and preserve criminal identification records; and to obtain information on all matters affecting the public interest''.\"The DI was the brainchild of the late Commonwealth President MANUEL L. QUEZON and the then Secretary of Justice JOSE YULO. A veteran American police officer, Capt. THOMAS DUGGAN of the New York Police Department (NYPD) and the only Filipino member of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), FLAVIANO GUERRERO, were hired by the Philippine Government to organize the Division of Investigation of the Department of Justice.The formation of the DI generated considerable public interest wherein more than 3,000 applied for the initial 48 positions of NBI Agents. Physical and medical examinations were conducted by doctors of the Philippine General Hospital and San Lazaro Hospital. Of the 3,000 applicants, only 150 were allowed to take the mental test and of this number, less than 100 passed, and after the screening, 48 were certified for employment. Of these successful candidates, only 45 actually accepted appointments as Agents."}, {"ori_label": 41, "name": "..::  MICG-MARKETING & INVESTMENT CONSULTING GROUP ::..", "description": "2006

If there is any investor out there thinking why they should be investing in Nigeria? Then here are some indicators which can help them with their decision making. Developing countries like Brazil, India and South Africa have proven to be great locations to invest in the last 2 decades. Perhaps it is time investors explore more of such economies and one of them certainly is Nigeria.\n2. Abundant Natural Resources Some of the natural resources found in Nigeria are natural gas, petroleum, tin, iron ore, coal, limestone, niobium, lead, zinc, and arable land. Nigeria is the largest oil producer in Africa and is ranked the 10th largest oil producer internationally. The Oil sector contributes to 28% of the countries GDP. With such dependency on natural resources, investors can confidently invest in businesses like mining, oil exploration, oil refineries etc. Also with oil being their major contributor and demand for oil not going down any time in the future, one can foresee a stable economic future for Nigeria. Investors are usually concerned about the stability and continuity and this type of economy is sustainable in the long run.\n3. Robust Economy Nigeria has been attracting maximum foreign direct investment when compared to other countries in Africa. Recent economic figures released show Nigeria as the largest economy in Africa with a GDP of $510 billion. Along with the oil sector, Nigeria is witnessing a healthy growth in agriculture, communication and service sector. The government has managed to create a very business friendly climate through its policy measures. The thrust through different policies and programmes is to push Nigeria to a free market economy. This has resulted in a very efficient bureaucratic system which is streamlined to eliminate any avoidable delays which can have negative impact on the investment friendly climate.\n4. Infrastructure When compared to some other African countries Nigeria has relatively advanced infrastructure facilities like power, ports and air transport. Other areas like communication, drinking water and irrigation are also seeing a lot of progress. After the reforms the telecom sector is seeing an explosive growth. When it comes to roads the country is covered by a network of federal and secondary roads. Nigeria also has 4 international airports and 6 seaports. With such facilities in place, if there is any country you can invest your money on in Africa then it can only be Nigeria.\n5. Dynamic Private Sector Nigeria is planning to upscale its economy in the next 10 years to a middle income economy. One of the ways identified by government to work towards this is through public private partnerships. One great example of how a private sector has managed to play a critical role is the Eco Atlantic development done in the country\u2019s commercial hub Lagos. Here the project aims at building business and residential areas on a land reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean. The Eco Atlantic project is completely overseen by private sector. The South Energyx Nigeria, a subsidiary of the Clangour group is in charge of this. Another area which is seeing a lot of private sector involvement is electricity generation and distribution. With a promising economic future, the private sector participation is only going to increase and this augurs well for investors looking to invest in Nigeria.\n6. Huge domestic market As per the report published on Investment U, Nigeria is identified as having a large domestic market with considerable demand for goods and services produced domestically. As the economy is growing, Nigeria is witnessing growth of increasingly sophisticated middle class. Middle class is an engine of growth which will further push the Nigerian economy. The presence of a large middle class means for investors a huge domestic market for any business they plan to invest in. Now with a population of 173 million Nigeria is the world\u2019s seventh most populous country. Analysts see the population growth pattern as similar to that witnessed in Asia between 1970 and 2000. One of the reasons for growth seen in Asia was due to the increasing share of working age population."}, {"ori_label": 41, "name": "Real Estate Investing That Works", "description": "Real Estate Investing That Works is a proven system created by successful real estate investor & mentor Mike Gazzola who\u2019s made millions of dollars buying & selling over 400 properties in the last 12 years.

Mike provides step-by-step guidelines and instruction for:\n\u2022\tFinding properties not available on the MLS\n\u2022\tStrategies that make sure you are always buying below market value\n\u2022\tFlipping homes online without remodeling\n\u2022\tRemodeling & flipping online for hefty profits\n\u2022\tHow to find local contractors that won\u2019t rip you off\n\u2022\tBuying & holding property to receive monthly rental income\n\u2022\tTechniques for becoming a 30-day landlord where you buy the property, rent it out and then resell for a much higher profit because it is already generating rental income\n\u2022\tHow to find local property managers that won\u2019t rip you off\nSome properties Mike has purchased are fixed up, rented and sold, all within a 30-day period. Homes with rental income sell for far more money (and faster) than vacant homes with no history of monthly income. In many cases he becomes what he likes to call a \u201c30-day landlord.\u201d\nYou can start with as little as $10,000 buying single-family homes, duplexes and land at foreclosure & tax deed auctions in the hottest markets in the country. Many of Mike\u2019s students have started with $2,000 to get their first property and then Mike shows how to build your bankroll incrementally buying and reselling properties quickly.\nMike\u2019s secret is to buy so far below market-value that you create instant equity. This enables you to resell quickly for a nice profit or to hold for reliable monthly rental income. It is also why Mike has never lost money on any property he bought and then sold.\nMike teaches what he has successfully done himself. There is no theory, no pie-in-the-sky promises, just practical proven techniques that really work.  He favors the path of least resistance and believes that the fastest easiest way to acquire single-family homes, duplexes and land is through local county property auctions. He teaches every detail you need to know to become an online property detective. Here\u2019s just a few of the important points his system reveals: \n\u2022\tHow to set up your bidder account for auctions; how to fund it, how much money you should put in your account and how to pay the balance due on your winning bids\n\u2022\tAll the top websites to find properties below market value and which ones are also perfect for selling your properties with little or no advertising cost\n\u2022\tA simple rule for buying land that will never let you down\nReal Estate Investing That Works also shows you how to convert your 401k or IRA into a self-directed IRA so you can use your retirement funds to buy and sell property to quickly increase the value of your retirement account tax free; or how you can set up educational savings accounts for your children and use your real estate investments to pay for their education tax free; and even how you can create a health savings account so that your real estate investments can pay for your health care tax free. \n Requirements: computer, Internet access, & cell phone.

The CBI was established in 1941 as the Special Police Establishment, tasked with domestic security. It was renamed the Central Bureau of Investigation on 1 April 1963. Its motto is \"Industry, Impartiality, Integrity\".Agency headquarters is in the Indian capital, New Delhi, with field offices located in major cities throughout India. The CBI is overseen by the Department of Personnel and Training of the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions of the Union Government, headed by a Union Minister who reports directly to the Prime Minister.

The functions of the SPE were to investigate bribery and corruption in transactions with the War and Supply Department of India, set up during World War II with its headquarters in Lahore. The superintendent of the War Department and the SPE was Khan Bahadur Qurban Ali Khan, who later became governor of the North West Frontier Province at the creation of Pakistan. The first legal advisor of the War Department was Rai Sahib Karam Chand Jain.

We help people think outside the box and let them know that they have choices about where they're going. A dream is as personal and different as the individual dreaming it. What makes one person happy may not be what another person is seeking in life. A dream can be:\n\n\n    Living a comfortable lifestyle\n    Retiring early\n    Traveling to exotic destinations\n    Owning a dream home\n    Owning a luxury car\n    Making a difference in you local community by supporting causes\n    Having financial security by building a recurring revenue stream\n    Building your own business\n    Spending more time with family and friends\n\n\nBut dreams can only become reality if you have the freedom and the means to accomplish them.

It\u2019s these three principles that have driven him his entire life.  He\u2019s a veteran insurance industry leader, working as a Managing Director with Desjardins Financial Security Independent Network (DFSIN) Richmond South office since 2009.  His efforts for authentic success has been proven,building a team of over 150 agents and focusing on helping them achieve excellence through organic, grass roots efforts in sales.Back in 1998, Perminder started his career in the financial services industry, joining Registered Education Savings Plan Company.  Within 6 months, he became their number one agent nationally.  From there, things began to grow at a rapid pace, one which he kept learning from in order to become a leader to others in their pursuit of financial and personal success.  Then he expanded into the life insurance industry, becoming a mentor and being instructional to over 200 agents.\n                Perminder\u2019s success is notable, but it did not come without a lot of hard work.  Having been raised in India, when Perminder moved to Canada he did not speak the English language. He didn\u2019t shy away from embracing opportunity, though.  He began creating challenges for himself that he was determined to conquer.  Learning the English language was one of those challenges and he set goals for himself to make that happen!  He fed off the energy that setting goals with deadlines gave him and  realized that any goals he may have could be achieved through a solid plan, a commitment to success, and, of course\u2014much hard work!\nCommunity involvement is another thing that Perminder is passionate about.  He is a tireless supporter of many activities and events that are important to the South Asian community in the Greater Vancouver Area.  His generosity and sponsorship include: fundraising for twenty different charities in the area, sponsoring sports activities and teams year after year, and even bringing fan favorite Bollywood acts to Canada to perform.He is also invited to present at awards ceremonies that honor achievement.\n                  To his community and work environment, Perminder is definitely a  valuable contributor; however, to his family he is considered a loving, caring father and husband.  When asked about he factors of his success, he always expresses that none of it would be possible without the support of his loving wife, Deep, and his children, Henna and Armaan.

In the busy day-to-day hustle of life many people are too busy to stop, step back and focus on their dreams. They keep moving forward without a vision as to where they want to go. IMG knows that you can't stuff a great life into a small dream. That's why we help people make decisions about what they want out of life. We help people think outside the box and let them know that they have choices about where they're going. A dream is as personal and different as the individual dreaming it. What makes one person happy may not be what another person is seeking in life. A dream can be:\n\n    Living a comfortable lifestyle\n    Retiring early\n    Traveling to exotic destinations\n    Owning a dream home\n    Owning a luxury car\n    Making a difference in you local community by supporting causes\n    Having financial security by building a recurring revenue stream\n    Building your own business\n    Spending more time with family and friends\n\nBut dreams can only become reality if you have the freedom and the means to accomplish them. We help put people back on track to their dreams by:\n\n    Helping families plan for their financial futures\n    Offering people a life-changing career opportunity\n\nAt IMG, we're committed to helping our clients and associates realize their dreams.\n\nWhat We Believe in?\n\n\"If only I had a chance...\"\n\nHow many times have you heard these words spoken by a friend or family member or uttered them from your own lips? The \"what ifs\" and \"if only\" can plague a person's psyche, focusing them on the rearview of regret rather than the possibilities of tomorrow. At International Marketing Group, giving people a chance is what we stand for. Whether you are a client interested in planning more effectively for your family's financial future or an entrepreneur interested in starting your own business with a solid company, IMG believes in providing a path to help you realize your dreams.\n\nWhat makes us different?\n\nIMG is one of the few companies of its kind in the industry today - a company dedicated to serving the financial needs of individuals and families who are typically overlooked by the financial services industry. IMG recognizes the need for widespread financial education, particularly among middle income individuals and families who could readily benefit from exposure to the latest financial concepts and solutions. Unlike many companies that target only wealthy clients, IMG is dedicated to teaching everyday people how to plan their financial futures and work toward their goals no matter what their income. Driven by its mission to help people around the world achieve financial independence, International Marketing Group and its thousands of associates in the United States and Canada introduce simple financial concepts to help clients understand how to put their money to work more effectively to move toward their goals. While many other financial services companies have a \"one size fits all\" attitude with little or no product choice, International Marketing Group advocates the power of choice. IMG has agreements with several of the leading companies in the financial services and insurance industries allowing associates to offer clients a wide array of products and services to choose from so they can find the ones that best fit their needs. And as clients' needs change, IMG's diverse product selection can grow with them.\n\nWhat future do associates have in IMG?\n\nAs a new associate of IMG you have opened the door on an exciting future. Through the IMG opportunity, you can build your own business, be your own boss, dream your own dreams. And while setting and reaching your own goals, you can help others reach theirs by educating them on the financial fundamentals that can lead them there. But even while you're in business for yourself, you're not by yourself. International Marketing Group is here to help providing excellent support through its Executive Headquarters as well as through access to powerful industry relationships, innovative training programs, a field-mentoring business model to help you build a strong financial services business. Plus, we offer exciting rewards and recognition for your hard work and determination. From Rings to Watches to exciting trips to Exotic Destinations around the world, we help make your effort well worth it.\n\nWhat help do IMG have?\n\nIMG is here to help you help yourself. We don't just want you to survive in this business we want you to prosper, which is why we strive to provide superior support and service to help you build your business. As an associate you are backed by the marketing and administrative muscle of the IMG Executive Headquarters and the support of experienced field leaders who've each built a successful financial services business from the ground up. The more than 50 employees at the headquarters go to work each day with one goal in mind: helping you build your business. These employees and every leader in the field are dedicated to helping you succeed.\n\n    Licensing and commissions support\n    Agent services\n    Provider relationship development\n    Professional marketing materials\n    Technology support\n    Corporate Intranet that gives you 24-hour access to important business tools, such as commission statements, product provider information, company news, and more...\n    Corporate website to help introduce potential clients and associates to IMG.\n\nWhat Earning potentials can IMG provide?\n\nIMG offers an excellent income opportunity, whether you're looking at the business as a twin career or a full-time commitment. With IMG's attractive compensation package, you can also take advantage of a number of incentives, including renewals, as well as participation in bonus pools and stock programs.\n\nWhat are the Membership Benefits?\n\nIMG wants to see all of its associates succeed. That's why IMG provides you with the corporate support and benefits you need to build a strong business. When you become a member of IMG, you and your business will benefit from:\n\n    The strength and credibility that comes with being a member of a respected corporate family\n    International expansion\n    Contract and product agreements already negotiated with credible product provider companies, providing the power of choice through the ability to sell many products instead of only one\n    Leveraging the relationships that IMG has forged with many of world's leading companies\n    An attractive, multigenerational compensation program\n    The possibility of stock options and re-insurance ownership\n    Access to an Associate Group Health Insurance Program for you and your family\n    Comprehensive training programs designed to get you licensed quickly and get your business up-and-running\n    Access to the latest technology\n    A mentoring business model that allows you to learn from some of the most experienced leaders in the financial services industry, all of whom are dedicated to seeing you succeed\n\nDo IMG Recognize & Rewards those great performances?\n\nIn addition to the rewards you receive from helping families achieve financial independence, IMG believes in recognizing and rewarding its associates for their initiative, drive and, ultimately, their success.

I\u2019m a self-made man who at a young age took hold of the American dream by turning my passion into my business. I have made my fortune by assisting others in profiting in coins and precious metals, and wish to share my expertise with others. \n\nI was fundamental in two dramatic changes that greatly assisted investor\u2019s, certified grading and electronic trading of coins and precious metals. (Co-founder of both the Professional Coin Grading Service and Certified Coin Exchange). I have shown thousands of investor\u2019s ways to profit. My recommendations, unlike most in our field, have not always been BUY recommendations but often SELL recommendations. I have been a guardian of my clients\u2019 money, and tied my fortune to their gains. In 1999 we strongly recommended selling pre-1964 junk silver coin when the premiums reached 100%. We had countless individuals switch to 100 oz. bars when the hysteria dictated they needed \u201cBarter Money\u201d. Our clients doubled their silver position and profited hugely!! \n\nToday many are investing in stocks like Amazon and Facebook that trade at PE\u2019s of 600 and 116 respectively. These are pre- \u201cdot.com\u201d bubble multiples. The Fed is printing money like never before. Our National Debt has tripled since 2000 and now tops $17 Trillion, a number so large virtually no one can comprehend it. \n\nOur Debt is greater than the GDP of all the European Union countries combined. That\u2019s England, Germany, France, Italy, Spain\u2026, and twenty-three more countries. \n\nWhen the \u201csmart money\u201d like Hedge Fund managers and billionaire investors are diversifying into gold, and when countries like China, India and OPEC nations are hoarding the precious metal, is it not time to take a closer look? \n\nMany consumers have nearly all of their investments in paper assets such as stocks and money market funds (I personally also have some of these types of assets). However in today\u2019s environment diversification is not only wise but essential. In the pages that follow we will illustrate that the stock market has frequent and severe corrections. It is precisely during these times that gold and tangibles are the saving grace. Tangibles even out the fluctuations and provide insurance against such turmoil. We at Tangible Investments specialize in these hard assets. We can provide you with tax free exchange into gold and precious metals IRAS. We can offer you pre-1933 U.S. gold for direct delivery, which offers private portable and liquid diversification for your portfolio. We have sold some of the greatest American rarities which have performed astronomically. We are here to serve you and our experienced staff is always available. \n\nSincerely, \n\nSilvano DiGenova \nPresident \nTangible Investments "}, {"ori_label": 41, "name": "University of Johannesburg Department of Finance and Investment Management", "description": "\n About Finance and Investment Management\n\nThe Department of Finance and Investment Management at UJ was formed after the merger between RAU (Rand Afrikaans University) and TWR (Technikon Witwatersrand) in 2005.

It's a partnership that combines the largest independently owned bank in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota with the tri-state area's largest private mortgage company - and one of the oldest in the country.\n\nWith its 130 years of history, Bell has proven that progressive, service-oriented business stands the test of time. Quite simply put, Bell Mortgage has been a part of Minnesota since its infancy. Five years before the first motorized car rolled down the street, 47 years before a young inventor applied for a patent on his \"image dissector\" or television, and years before our time - Bell Mortgage has been in the business of improving lives.\n\nThe history of Bell Mortgage dates back to 1858, when David C. Bell made Minneapolis home. Bell earned $25 a month in his first job, working as a clerk at a small general store on the south side of Nicollet Avenue. Later, Bell took on an admirable number of ventures starting with a stint as Hennepin County Treasurer. Soon he co-founded the YMCA, the American Automobile Association, a linseed oil company, several banks and ultimately a mortgage company under his name - David C. Bell Investment Company.\n\nIn 1880, Bell began originating mortgages in Minnesota and sold them to banks in New York. The first mortgage bond from the David C. Bell Investment Company was drawn up in 1888 for the sum of $3,500. The business Bell began not only employed numerous Minnesotans, it also brought a significant amount of money and development into the area. Perhaps that is why Mr. Bell is referred to, not only as an entrepreneur, but also one of the Twin Cities' founding fathers.\n\nThe David C. Bell Company continued to flourish, weathering The Great Depression, two World Wars and embracing nearly 100 years of local development before its purchase in 1980 by Gary Kirt. Kirt, known for his entrepreneurial spirit, has kept Bell on the cutting edge of trends in the mortgage industry as well as the pursuit of world-class technology solutions for its customers and employees. Bell's technology leads employees and customers from loan application to closing with efficiency and ease, simplifying a process that both processors and customers often consider difficult.\n\nBell continues to push the envelope via its proprietary systems and in turn, customers of Bell have access to numerous loan options and programs not typically available through other mortgage bankers.\n\nAnother staple at Bell is the way its employees do business, always putting the customer's needs first, while ensuring regulatory compliance. Kirt says Bell's reputation for ethical business conduct helps explain the organization's longevity and respect from its customers and competitors alike.\n\nAdditionally, Bell continues to forge positive relationships in the community through its active role in local charities including Simpson Housing Services, which provides a haven for homeless people in the Twin Cities. Bell not only gives financial support, but its employees also provide, prepare and serve hot meals monthly at Simpson - an activity Bell has taken part in for over 20 years.\n\nThe Boys and Girls Clubs of the Twin Cities also holds a special place in Mr. Kirt's heart. In fact, he spent many nights at the club as a child. Consequently, Kirt has been serving on the club's Board of Directors since 1980. Bell also provides financial support to the Boys and Girls Clubs and employees donate their time serving dinners on a regular basis.\n\nDuring the holidays, Bell employees have opted not to spend money on each other; rather they purchase gifts through the Hennepin County Children, Family and Adult Services Department. The organization is dedicated to low-income adults and mentally or physically challenged people in the Minneapolis area.\n\nA commitment to community spanning three centuries, the constant pursuit of cutting-edge technology, the best combination of products, prices and service, all backed by the experience and dedication of the best mortgage team in the country- that's Bell Mortgage and has been for over 130 years.\n\nNow a division of Bell State Bank & Trust, Bell Mortgage has 180 employees at 28 mortgage offices in the Twin Cities area, Bozeman, Mont., and Phoenix, Ariz., and, with its long history, more than 500,000 family mortgages to its name. \n\nChartered in 1966, Bell State Bank & Trust has 20 full-service bank locations in Fargo, West Fargo and Wahpeton, North Dakota, and Alexandria, Audubon, Breckenridge, Detroit Lakes, Dilworth, Fergus Falls, Hawley, Minneapolis, Pelican Rapids, Wahpeton, and Woodbury, Minnesota. We also have trust offices in Bismarck and Boise, Idaho. \n\nBell Mortgage, a division of Bell State Bank & Trust is a Member FDIC, Equal Employment Opportunity Employer and an Equal Housing Lender (We lend without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status). Trust & Investment services are not FDIC insured, have no bank guarantee, may lose value, not a deposit and not insured by federal government agency.\n\nRealize your comments are visible to the world, so avoid sharing your personal account information.

I am an IBRC Mortgage Holder and the person behind the IBRC mortgage holders strike page on Facebook. \nI set up the page shortly after I took part in a protest outside the dail with other IBRC mortgage holders. That was in February of this year.\nI filmed interviews with 5 TD\u2019s that day. Four suggested pressure and protest. Luke Flanagan suggested a mortgage strike. \n\nWhat he said made perfect sense to me.  I went and set up the IBRC Mortgage Holders strike page on Facebook. I thought that the idea would gain support from a large number of IBRC Mortgage Holders. I was wrong about that. \n\nThe strike received little or no support. I spent money to promote the page on facebook to get it out to as big an audience as possible. I posted articles which were relevant to mortgage holders. \nThere were a lot of likes, comments and shares but very little support for the strike. I started to look at other options. I sought advice from Tom Darcy. Tom has been in the high court 27 times and in the supreme court many times as well, all as a lay litigant. He won a case against AIB.\nI also went to the Hub. They are a voluntary organization with an office in Dublin and I hear THEY ARE OPENING IN GALWAY. The Hub offer help to people in trouble with mortgages. I received great advice from the HUB and Elizabeth Hourihane regarding seeking a judicial review of the IBRC legislation.\nI believe that if a large group of IBRC Mortgage holders came together in one group . That group would have a lot of power to negotiate. In my opinion there are 3 options open to such a group. Here are the 3 options in no particular order.\n\nStart a mortgage strike\n\nSeek an interlockutory injunction to stall the sale of the remaining mortgages. Possibly a judicial review of the ibrc liquidation legislation. \nThe third option is to use the strength of the group to negotiate with IBRC on a writedown. If we were say 1000 strong with the average mortgage at 100,000 that is 100 million. \nOthers have already gotten write downs on big amounts like that. We are being told that they can not deal with individual mortgage holders. How could they refuse to negotiate with us if we had 100 million in mortgage debt to negotiate with.?\nIf you are an IBRC mortgage holder and you would like become a member just send a message  to this page IBRC Mortgage Holders Strike to say that you wish to become a member of the group.\n The message can be either public or private. I will publish on the page just the numbers that joining up weekly. You do not have to sign anything or pay any money. This will be in informal group .\nSoon I will call a meeting where we can consider our options and vote on them. \nOn May 31 st we had our first meeting at the red cow hotel in Dublin. There were 15 people in the room. It was a very good meeting. Tom Darcy gave an excellent presentation and hosted a question and answer session. There was good debate and exchange of information. \nA couple who were at the meeting had a sad story to tell. They and their 4 children were facing eviction. Fortunately we were able to help them. Noel Bropy and Davey Walsh of debt solutions in carrick on suir and Brian Kavanagh and myself were at the court with them last Wednesday. The case was adjourned for six months.\nIt was a real eye opener for me to see people who were distraught about the loss of their family home. The smiles on their faces outside the court last wednesday was a joy to behold. They are now working with debt solutions and considering their next move.\nTheir story made me realize that there are a lot of mortgage holders out there in difficulties and they simply do not know where to turn. If you are one of those people please contact this page and I will do my best to refer you on to people who can help like the hub or debt solutions\n\nI would like to appeal to the other IBRC groups to stand with us.  It makes sense for us to come together. The bigger our number the more powerful we become.\n \n\n If this can work for IBRC Mortgage holders it can work for mortgage holders with other banks as well. If other groups are formed they will also be in a strong position to negotiate. And then if all the groups joined together we would be in a very strong position to negotiate.\n\nI believe there is a real opportunity here to take back control of our mortgages \nThere is benefit accrueing to privately owned unregulated vulture funds through the sale of Irish mortgages. Why can that benefit not be given to the Irish mortgage holders themselves. It would be an enormous benefit to all concerned including the economy.\n\n\n"}, {"ori_label": 21, "name": "Mortgage Architects - Kalson Jang", "description": "Finding the best mortgage can be an intimidating task.

A little over a month ago a nice family saved me from a very abusive home where I was choked multiple times and kicked in the throat and face also, I weigh 2 lbs.  The family nursed the wounds they could see, my eyes were especially bad, they were swollen shut.  But I couldn't eat for the family and they got very scared and found a rescue to help them.  My food would only go down a tiny bit and then it would come out my nose and mouth, mixed with a lot of sticky slobber and the choking was horrible, I was so hungry.  This is how I ended up where I am today. \n\n I was very sick and very skinny in the beginning and no one thought I would live, even the first vet I went to with the rescue lady said there was was little to no hope.   Oh my, the rescue lady is stubborn and she said she would not quit until I quit!!  I was very tired and laid very still at the vets office, I was so weak and skinny that most people didn't see me laying on the rescue lady's lap.  But when rescue lady got to McDonalds I perked up and said hi to everyone, it sure smelled good there, I was so hungry.  \n\n On the way home from the vet the rescue lady, who is now rescue mom Mary, gave me some whipped cream smeared very light on the lid of her coffee and I licked it and didn't choke at all!  This gave Mom Mary the idea that maybe there was a way to help me, just small amounts so I couldn't choke.  I kept hearing the rescue lady talk about when I got healthy enough we could go see a vet that specialized in very hurt and sick puppies, like me.  I began getting better and the family that saved me originally offered to foster me for a while and I did good for a few days, but on the 5th day I got very sick and everyone, once again,  thought I was going to die, I was so sick that I thought I was going to die too.  \n\nI am now back with the rescue lady and have been for 10 days, it has been hard, I have choked more than before and I have had a couple very scary times.  But I am getting better!!  I want to be alive and play like normal puppies play.  \n\n I went to the special vet yesterday in a big city (mom got lost, like usual I heard her say) and they said that I am still a little too sick for surgery but hopefully next week I will be good enough, since everyday I am drinking more and feeling better.  It is going to cost a lot try to get me better!!  But rescue Mom does think I am worth it and so does everyone else that meets me!!  \n\nThe special vet says my throat has a stricture, most likely caused from eating something that burnt my throat or getting something sharp caught in my throat, since I can't talk I can't tell anyone what really did happen.  The special vet says that they will do a surgery that blows the closed part up and they will put a tube in my side for mom Mary to feed me.......  It all sounds scary, but I am strong and I am excited to be a real puppy.  The special vet said I may need to have my throat blown up 3 more times and each time it is a surgery.  So here I am, I am trying to get better for surgery, I am anemic and we are working on that......  I am also asking for help with my surgery, in the end it will be between $3000 and $4000 dollars.  I know that's a lot, but the alternative is not acceptable.  If you would like to help me you can email my rescue mom, Mary, @ forsacredhearts@gmail.com or you can donate money through paypal with that same email.

They face a nearly impossible battle against the Chinese, the Taliban, and local politics to save their culture and heritage from permanent erasure.\n\nFor the past three years, the effort of director Brent E. Huffman through Saving Mes Aynak has played a vital role in delaying the demolition of this historical treasure, but again time is quickly running out. The Chinese State-owned mining company still has immediate plans to destroy Mes Aynak, and it could happen AT ANY MOMENT.  Now, the only way for Mes Aynak to be saved is if the Afghan government intervenes, halts mining, and officially petitions to UNESCO to make Mes Aynak a World Heritage Site. Only the Afghan government can approach UNESCO. \n\nThrough our film Saving Mes Aynak, our major goal is to raise mass awareness of the impending demolition, creating an international movement to put pressure on the mining company, the Afghanistan government, and UNESCO to make Mes Aynak a World Heritage Site.\nThis is the ONLY WAY to #SAVEMESAYNAK.\n\nThe more funds we raise, the more people will see the film and know the beauty and importance of Mes Aynak, and the greater the chance of Mes Aynak being saved. To do this, the focal point of our campaign is #SaveMesAynak Day on July 1st, a global event where supporters everywhere will stream the film and stand in unity together to save Mes Aynak. Through social media, we plan to use this day to spark worldwide protest, conversation, and action. After that, we will mount an ambitious outreach effort through our film to reach as many people as we can. The more awareness we can raise, the larger the pressure we can put on the Afghan government to stop the demolition, and to formally petition UNESCO. This way, we can ensure Mes Aynak's safety for future generations. \n\nLet's work together, and make history by saving history.

Although a number of groups have sought to display the iconic relic of the 1939 film, it has never been available for the public to view ... until now.\n\nThe many pieces of the movie home to Gerald O\u2019Hara and his family have been lying in storage waiting for the right time to come out of hibernation and make a grand appearance once more. It has survived the ravages of weather and neglect on the back lot of the Selznick (later Desilu) Studios, the dismantling and shipping to Georgia where it has been loaded and reloaded by governmental and private groups seeking to build a permanent home, to its current resting place not far from the kitchen of the lady who sought it, bought it and protected it throughout her life.\n\nDue to a long relationship with the owners and his connection to \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d thru his internationally known tours, Peter Bonner has come with his film crew, his experts and his willing volunteers to \u201cpowder her nose\u201d and put the fa\u00e7ade on camera once again.\n\nPeter plans to tell the story of her survival, film her restoration and provide a way for her fans all over the world to come and visit her in time for her 75th birthday in 2014.\n\nWatch Peter Bonner Explain How He is \u201cSaving Tara\u201d:\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/71863639\n\nPeter Bonner Historical And Hysterical Tours \u00a9TM\n\nPeter Bonner is an historian, public speaker and author renowned for his intimate knowledge of all things \u201cGone With The Wind\u201d and Margaret Mitchell. Peter is also an acknowledged expert on Southern history and the Civil War. Peter's emphasis is always the human side of the story, which can often be as hysterical as it is historical.\n\nHistorical And Hysterical Tours \u00a9TM combine Peter Bonner\u2019s two great loves - history and entertainment. His tours have brought more than $5-million in tourist spending to the Jonesboro and Atlanta, Georgia region over the last fifteen years. The tour is licensed to the Road To Tara Museum in Jonesboro,Georgia and Peter also conducts tours himself. \n\nThousands of people have experienced Peter\u2019s unique programs and tours over the years, delighting people of all ages, from the school children who marvel at the heaviness of the black powder gun to the senior citizens who remember similar stories told to them by their grandparents.\n\nPeter\u2019s book \u201cLost In Yesterday\u201d (http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Yesterday- Peter-Bonner/dp/0971615896) details the real people, places and historic events that influenced Margaret Mitchell\u2019s book \u201cGone With The Wind\u201d and the subsequent Academy Award-winning movie of the same name. \u201cLost In Yesterday\u201d is the result of many years of propriety research, personal interviews and detective work.\n\nIn the process of compiling stories for a book on the Civil War Battle of Jonesboro (Georgia), Peter noticed an unusual number of personal accounts from 1864 that mirrored the tales of the characters in Margaret Mitchell's \u201cGone With The Wind\u201d.\n\nUpon further research, Peter found in a letter dated July 11, 1936, where Margaret stated, \"... all the incidences in the book are true.\" Margaret spent many hours of her childhood \"on bony knees, fat, slick taffeta laps, and soft, flowered muslin laps...while they spiritedly re-fought the Civil War.\"\n\n###\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION: \n\nTel: 770.477.8864 \nWeb: www.peterbonner.com\nE-MAIL: Peter@PeterBonner.com\n\nNEWS AND MEDIA ENQURIES:\n\nPorter Versfelt III\nVersfelt Communications Group Atlanta, Georgia - USA\nTel: +1 678.469.6224\nE-mail: vcgtv@yahoo.com \n\n"}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Saving SPOT!

We work closely with our veterinary partners, trainers, healers and volunteers to assure all our dogs health and emotional needs are met.\n\nEach SPOT! rescue dog is given a full physical examination by our veterinarians Dr. Peter Erling and Dr. Michelle Lorenzen. Our dogs are fully vaccinated and spayed/neutered (as age appropriate), microchipped, given 14 days of antibiotics, treated for worms and fleas, tested for parvo and giardia and given a complete physical exam.\n\nEvery SPOT! rescue is given a full grooming by our in house award winning groomer Jennifer Guidone.\n\nAdoption\n Each family that wants to adopt a SPOT! rescue is fully vetted and approved by the rescue organizers. Because we feel that each and every one of our dogs is an individual we require that an application be filled out for the specific dog that you or your family connect with. Although our dogs can be seen on facebook we want your entire family to meet the dog and be a part of the adoption process. Once an application is submitted on a dog it is reviewed and the prospective family is interviewed by someone on the Saving SPOT! team. If the application is approved we let the new parents know as soon as possible. Because we interact with the rescues daily and they live with us we feel we know them very well and are able to assess in what environment they will thrive. We are truly looking for the best possible home for each and every one of our rescue dogs.\n\nOnce an application is approved, the new parent/ family comes to the store to sign a contract promising to provide and care for their newly adopted family member. They receive a complete packet with everything they need to know about their new pet and numerous other related resources. At SPOT! pet boutique we have everything you could possibly need for your new baby and hope that you will purchase those items from SPOT! because every dollar spent at SPOT! contributes to our rescue efforts.\n"}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Saving OAK FLAT Campground", "description": "PUBLIC LAND!!!

The story opens with a prologue in which a veteran brings his family to the American cemetery at Normandy, and a flashback then joins Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and GIs in a landing craft making the June 6, 1944, approach to Omaha Beach to face devastating German artillery fire. This mass slaughter of American soldiers is depicted in a compelling, unforgettable 24-minute sequence. Miller's men slowly move forward to finally take a concrete pillbox. On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name \"Ryan\" stenciled on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), learning that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon), be located and brought back to the United States. Capt. Miller gets the assignment, and he chooses a translator, Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davis), skilled in language but not in combat, to join his squad of right-hand man Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), plus privates Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), cynical Reiben (Edward Burns) from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo (Vin Diesel), and religious Southerner Jackson (Barry Pepper), an ace sharpshooter who calls on the Lord while taking aim. Having previously experienced action in Italy and North Africa, the close-knit squad sets out through areas still thick with Nazis. After they lose one man in a skirmish at a bombed village, some in the group begin to question the logic of losing more lives to save a single soldier. The film's historical consultant is Stephen E. Ambrose, and the incident is based on a true occurance in Ambrose's 1994 bestseller D-Day: June 6, 1944.

Abused and an ex-fighting dog, he had no chance of survival. He was property of the FCAC shelter in Rome, Georgia where the county has a ban on adopting out Pit Bulls, period. This twisted ideology is called BSL or Breed Specific Legislation, where a dog is not just a dog, but targeted with prejudice.  The statistics today are that very few pit bulls will make out of shelter alive.  Whilst we are not focused or capable to be a large volume, pit bull rescue, but a foundation, we still get involved in rescuing as many dogs as we can & also can link you to organizations that can help. \n\n \n\nIt is devastating to read news stories where people have been hurt by a dog. Often an abused, mistreated and mismanaged dog(s). This should not be happening,  especially if the right resources were in place. BSL has proven that it is not effective. All dogs can be potentially dangerous & of course, some can do more damage than others. We must respect the strength and ability of any dog, keeping them and the public safe and increase the consequences when people do not abide by the laws. \n\n \n\nPit Bulls are often extremely intelligent dogs that are classified into the category of working dogs. They are not a dog that you place in the backyard and ignore... they are a sensitive, very high energy dog with a lot of drive and a need for regular mental and physical stimulation.  Otherwise, problems can arise. With pent up frustration, often they will want to escape from their yard and this is when we hear about a problem stemming from it in the news. Pit Bulls are very loving dogs, they bond very closely with their owner.  A person once said to me that a pit bull is unique because it will look you straight in the eyes, deep into your soul and connect with you; whereas, most dogs will just want to be pet and scratched.  The public has been tainted by the news media that pours out sensationalisms like a pit bulls jaws can lock or they can ''snap'' at any minute... or reporting on a dog attack that didn't even involve a pit bull, but calling it a pit bull. Simply put, pit bulls are just dogs. No breed of dog  can lock its' jaws and no specific breed, \"can snap at any minute\"... There are good dogs and bad dogs in all the canine varieties. Sadly pit bulls are often owned by people that should not own them and want them for more of a status symbol, than being a member of their family.\n\n \n\nThe goal of the Foundation is Education, Advocacy and Resources : Education to help pet owners to create a deeper bond with their dogs, empowering them to become more responsible, keeping them and the public safe. Teaching the public about the misconceptions that have been bred by the media; helping to increase the number of adoptions in shelters by families that wouldn't normally consider adopting a pit bull ~ through education and advocacy. Lastly, RESOURCES through fund raising for local pit bull rescues that do the hands-on, hard work.  Any monies raised are strictly for the Foundation & its' work. We have an open book policy & want to assure people that any funds will be appropriately used. We believe we will never adopt our way out of this epidemic of over population, but rather through spay neuter programs, clinics and support.

But this dog was in his own home and yard each time someone entered without permission.

She just battled through a bone marrow transplant where we did not have a matching donor however had a cord blood that was close enough to go through the transplant. Five months after the transplant she relapsed once again and now we need to look at going to the US for treatment that is not offered in Canada in order to save her life. The treatment cost is from $500,000 - $800,000 USD which is why are fund raising. We have been researching whatever options we could find including a clinical trial which injects fighter cells to try and attack the leukemia cells and just found out that we also have at least a two month wait to get into the trial. We are praying for a miracle and hope she is eligible for a program such as this. \n\nAnya is a smart, intelligent, giving little girl that just wants to have fun and bring joy to others. To give you an idea of her demeanour, when Santa Clause came to see her at Sick Kids Hospital in Toronto during her bone marrow transplant and asked her what she wanted for Christmas, she replied with \"Presents for all of the sick kids here in the hospital\". Her braveness is unbelievable and really is an inspiring little girl to a lot of people. I would say the strongest people in my family are certainly my daughter at a hard number one, followed by my wife at a close second, then myself and my four year old boy at distant third and fourth. We are looking to raise money only to give her the best chance to live and any extra will be put right back into supporting someone or people who need it in similar situations to us. Another great example of my daughters mindset is, just before the recent relapse I went to South Africa for work and just as I was departing for the airport she ran to the door with her piggy bank asking me to give the money she had saved to the people who need it most in South Africa. I made sure to help someone there and captured some pics so Anya could see how she helped someone on the other side of the world. Her kind heart deserves a chance at life where she doesn't have to live in pain or in hospitals as since 2 1/2 years old she has been fighting harder than most. \n\nWe appreciate any and all help and are committed to continue the fight of giving back. We are just battling something at the moment and if we can save my daughters life we can concentrate on continuing to give back and help others who need it as well. Thank you so much and I can assure you we are doing everything we can to give my daughter a real chance to get better. I am certain she is destined to be somebody great! \n\nThank you, \n\nMartinez family."}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Save Ferris", "description": "Ska-Pop-Punk-Swing\n\n\n"}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Saving Stimpy", "description": "One of the best cover bands in Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky, and Southeast Indiana covering tunes from the 80's, 90's and today's music.

I was hooked. \n\nIn 2003 my first 4 mini's came into my life and my adventures in the wonderful world of the miniature horse began.\n\n In 2004 I became a member of the Blue Water Miniature Horse Club (BWMHC) where over the years I have made some amazing friends and many wonderful memories. During my time with the BWMHC I was very actively involved serving on several committees and enjoyed every minute of it. I was the newsletter editor for 8 years (2004-2011). I also served on the board of directors as treasurer for 4 years (2008-2011). From 2007-2010 the club's fun shows were held at my farm...these are some of my greatest memories, spending time with amazing friends both old and new and our wonderful little horses.\n\nIn 2009 I became involved with Chance's Miniature Horse Rescue (CMHR), first as a member then as a director at large. I became a foster home for this nationwide rescue in 2010 and since then I have fostered several horses. In May of 2010 I was asked to be treasurer for the rescue and I gladly accepted. As my passion for rescue grew I decided to make some changes and devote more of myself to making a difference in the lives of these little horses. So in December of 2011 I resigned my positions of treasurer and newsletter editor with the BWMHC to follow my heart which has led me on a amazing journey.

While writing his doctoral thesis on the history of the credit union movement at New York University, Bill was advised by his close friend Thomas \"Cork\" Corcoran to put his education to use and start a credit union himself. Bill and Kay first approached fellow teachers and offered free membership to school employees throughout Hudson County.\n \n Starting out with no paid staff and just 68 members signing up for payroll deduction, the credit union grew slowly at first. At the end of 1952, the credit union had 251 members and held $39,192 is assets. Bill and Kay ran the small institution out of their home on Columbia Avenue, taking deposits and making loans across the kitchen table.\n \nAs the credit union grew stronger, more groups looked for our services to be provided for their employees.  In 1977 our name changed to Educational Federal Credit Union.  In the late 1970's and early 1980's, several smaller credit unions joined forces with Educational FCU and a result of the mergers, our credit union grew tremendously.\n \n As we began to acquire Select Employee Groups outside of the education industry, our board and management felt that Educational FCU did not adequately reflect our expanding base of membership; therefore, in 1986, we changed our name to Liberty Savings Federal Credit Union.\n\nIn addition to the almost 200 Select Employee Groups that we currently serve throughout northern NJ, we can also offer membership to anyone who lives, works, worships, or attends school anywhere in Hudson County. \n \nToday LSFCU boasts over $50 million in assets and we have over 16,000 members.  We offer a compelling variety of new and innovative financial products and services while at the same time cherishing the \"old time values\" that Bill & Kay Miller had in mind all those years ago.

Cut-off ranges vary between 1 in 150 (a 0.7% chance) and 1 in 300 (a 0.3% chance).  \n\nAround 1 in 20 (5%) of pregnant women will have an increased chance result at a 1:300 cut-off. The natural live birth rate of Down syndrome is around 1 in 500 pregnancies (0.2%).\n\nFor some parents, screening can be helpful to prepare for the birth of their child. \n\nSome parents choose to not use screening at all due to the possibility of anxiety and stress associated with the process. \n\nSaving Downs advocates that screening should be optional as an informed choice and not be considered an element of routine pregnancy care. \n\nDiagnostic tests\n\nAn invasive diagnostic test is required to determine whether Down syndrome is present in a pregnancy following an increased chance result from prenatal screening. \n\nFor every 200 woman who have an invasive diagnostic test, one or two will have a miscarriage as a result of the test. The tests can also cause other harm to the child. Statistically, the risk of harm exceeds the medical benefits to the child that rely on a confirmed pre-birth diagnosis. \n\nFor some parents diagnostic tests can be a valuable information tool to prepare for the birth of their child. \n\nSome women choose to not have diagnostic tests due to the risk of harm to their pregnancies. \n\nSaving Downs advocates that parents must be fully informed as to the risks of diagnostic testing.\n\nSaving Downs advocates that diagnostic tests must respect the life and integrity of the unborn child, cause no harm, be only directed towards safeguarding or healing the unborn child and be presented in a way that does not discriminate against people with Down syndrome.\n\nAdoption\n\nThere are many families who are interested in adopting a child with Down syndrome. Saving Downs can direct parents to relative support groups.\n\nPregnancy termination\n\nSaving Downs does not consider a diagnosis of Down syndrome to be a reason for terminating a pregnancy. Parents should continue to be fully supported through the pregnancy.\n\nContact us at savingdowns@gmail.com"}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Saving Super Nova", "description": "Nova was born 15 weeks too soon on 10.17.12 weighing only 1 lb 13 oz.

This page was created by volunteers to showcase animals held in high kill shelters with little to no exposure.   Our current focus is on the dogs held in Smith County\u2019s shelter in Tyler, TX.  The facility is not open to the public so there is no foot traffic to help with adoptions & rescues.  The shelter is currently under the operation of the Fire Marshal's Office as of 10/1/2014.  Smith County inmates are transported to the shelter every morning to clean and care for the dogs.  There is no permanent staff on site at the present time. \n\nBefore Saving Animals from Euthanasia in Texas was started in June 2013 it is estimated that approximately 99% of healthy and adoptable dogs entering the Smith County shelter were killed.  For 6 years this went on, under the radar and unchecked at the cost of approximately 8,000 dog\u2019s lives.  After only a few months with only a few volunteers and very few resources we have brought Smith County statistically to No Kill.  Today, more dogs are leaving Smith County Shelter alive than any other time in its history.  However, in order for this to continue the shelters themselves must step up and make the commitment to strive for No Kill.  The community must step up and demand nothing less from our municipal shelters, local shelters, animal welfare organizations and rescue groups.\n\nThe good news is that Smith County and Tyler can lead the way for our area in becoming a No Kill Community using the No Kill Equation: a philosophy which has been proven to work across the country to save more than 90% of shelter animals. There are currently more than 300 No Kill Communities across the country representing some 500 cities.  These communities are both urban and rural; they are wealthy and poor; they are liberal and conservative.  The one thing all of these communities have in common is a desire to save the lives of homeless animals while saving money in the process.  Many of the programs identified as key components of saving lives are more cost-effective than impounding, warehousing, and then killing animals as saving the lives of animals is revenue-positive in the community. \n\nWhat do these communities have that we don\u2019t have?  Nothing.  We are proud.  We are progressive.  We are smart and we are creative.  Let there be no doubt we can learn from other regions and find ways to save lives of the companion animals we love and value.\n\nFor more information:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/smithcountypetsalive \nhttp://www.smithcountypetsalive.org/ \n"}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Saving German Shepherds on Death Row", "description": "To help attract rescue and possibly attract GSD rescues in the Midwest and East Coast who are looking to save these dogs..."}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Save the Bats", "description": "Bats are essential to the health of our ecosystem.

Knowledge is the key. \n\nWe work to help protect bats and the ecosystem by teaming up with local health departments and government agencies to aid in public health issues associated with bats. We also employ trained field biologists to help in the research to protect endangered bats and other animals.\n\nIf you have a wild bat or other animal in your home, please call Critter Catchers for humane removal: 248-432-2712.\n\nCurrently, our North American bat population is declining at an alarming rate due to a number of causes, including White Nose Syndrome. Bats are an important part of our ecosystem \u2013 for one, they cut down on those pesky mosquitoes and other bugs! They are also crucial pollinators of many crops, including mango, cashew, balsa, agave and bananas.\n\nJoin the effort to Save the Bats, so we can help prevent further loss of population, encourage spread of new populations, and share an appreciation for these friendly nocturnal creatures.\n\nHang around our page for updates on the campaign, fun facts about bats, and ways you can take action in your community and inspire others to join the cause!\n\nFollow posts and share your own along your social networks with #SavetheBats\n\nThe Save the Bats campaign is led by the Organization for Bat Conservation, an educational nonprofit based in Michigan.

The story is based on the legendary Generals of the Yang Family. The film was selected as part of the 2013 Hong Kong International Film Festival.PlotIt is early Northern Song dynasty, AD 986, in Northeastern China. The film starts as Yang Ye (Adam Cheng), the leader of the Yang Clan and General for Song, executes 30 whiplashes to his youngest and second youngest child. They participated in a kung fu tournament which caused the death of a rival clan's son. The following morning, the two clan leaders meet with the emperor about the issue when the signaling stations (used for warning an oncoming invasion by their neighboring country) ignites.It was the Khitan army invading, hoping to take its revenge on Yang Clan for a past massacre that killed the former Khitan general. It was noted that the leader of the oncoming Khitan army is led by the son of the former Khitan general. Due to politics and the recent death of rival clan's son, the rival clan leader is awarded with 50,000 troops to welcome the Khitan army. As punishment, General Yang is awarded to lead the charge and be the scout for Song Dynasty. When the two armies meet, the lack of leadership by the rival clan leader causes chaos among the Song army as Khitan takes a decisive victory. All the while, General Yang is trapped behind enemy lines as the retreat horn sounds.The chaos causes General Yang Ye to be trapped in an abandoned town in front of Wolf Mountain, as the Khitan army surrounds the town, allowing no one to leave. Song's army, now led by the clan rival, refuses to help and rescue Yang Ye (assumed to be politics again among the clan rivals). This leaves Yang Ye's wife devestated as she sends her seven sons to rescue him. It is later revealed that this is exactly what the Khitan general wanted, and the seven sons fall into their deadly trap."}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Saving Kentucky Shelter Animals", "description": "WHO WE ARE:\nSaving Kentucky Shelter Animals connects rescues/adopters/fosters with shelter animals in the state of Kentucky, to increase state-wide save rates.

On Jan. 11th Cheshire Abbey received a call that an injured dog had been either thrown out or abandoned and had taken up residence under a trailer home in South Jackson. He was cold, malnourished, had scars all over his head and neck and was  unable to walk. Mrs. Suzie and her daughter went to try and help, Cooper saw us and literally drug his little broken body to us wagging his tail the entire time:) He let us load him into the car and we headed to the Emergency Vet......not before stopping for some yummy people food on the way for him to fill up on. The 2 Vets at the Emergency Clinic told us he had nerve damage to his front left leg and multiple fractures to his rear left leg, they said it would be impossible to repair and he would not have any quality of life, our best option was to put him to sleep and end his suffering. We sincerely felt as if we had no choice and signed the papers to have him euthanized. My daughter and I had been joined by Chrissy Cheshire with Cheshire Abbey, a local animal rescue group and we all 3 cried while signing the papers to allow them to end his life. My daughter and I left, I was hyperventilating while my 15 year old daughter tried to tell me we were doing the right thing. I just could not imagine having to put him down, he literally snuggled and licked Tyler the whole way to the Vet and was so genuinely happy to have us there to help him. About an hour later I received a call from Chrissy, she had contacted other rescue groups who joined her at the Vet and after visiting with Cooper they decided he ad way to much personality to be put down, they found a video of another 2 legged dog named \"super fifty boy\" and he became our inspiration to try and save Cooper. Our hope is that Cooper will make a full recovery, we don't know if he will end up with 2 legs or 3, we are desperately trying for 3 but its not likely. We are hoping that once healed and rehabilitated, Cooper will be an inspiration to those who have lost a limb....... or two:) He has such an amazing personality  and is such a charmer he simply deserves a chance.

It follows London-based Pakistani plastic surgeon Dr. Mohammad Jawad as he journeys to Pakistan to perform reconstructive surgery on survivors of acid violence. Saving Face broaches the subject of the under-reporting of acid violence against women due to cultural and structural inequalities towards women from Pakistani men. The Acid Survivors Foundation of Pakistan, which is featured in the film, had documented more than 100 acid attacks a year in Pakistan but estimates far more due to lack of reporting.Obaid-Chinoy has stated that the film is \"a positive story about Pakistan on two accounts: firstly, it portrays how a Pakistani-British doctor comes to treat them and it also discusses, in great depth, the parliament\u2019s decision to pass a bill on acid violence\".

Then Judd Travers shows up at the Preston home with dead squirrels as a present for Marty and his family for helping him after his truck accident in the second film. A fearful Shiloh runs into the kitchen since he is still scared of Judd. Marty's sister, Becky , embarrasses her mother, Louise , when she calls Judd the meanest man since Judd says he has eaten dead squirrels all his life. Soon, Marty hears from his two best friends, David Howard and Samantha Wallace , that after a fist fight, a drunken Judd has been charged with murder. Marty brings Judd some squirrel stew and offers to help Judd, believing that he hasn't committed murder. Soon after, when Marty is helping Judd build a fence for his hunting dogs, Judd accidentally steps on one of his dog's paws. The dog starts attacking Judd, biting his good leg. Judd doesn't show any fear, grabbing the dog and swinging him at a fence. Afterwards, when Dara Lynn , another of Marty's sisters, falls into a lake, Marty jumps in to save her. Shiloh jumps in to help but gets caught in the current, which leads toward Miller Falls. Marty goes back into the lake to save Shiloh but gets caught in a branch. Seeing this, Judd jumps off a cliff into the lake to free Marty. Marty explains to Judd that Shiloh is going to go over the waterfall unless he saves him. Judd saves Shiloh and begins a friendship with Marty and Shiloh.

It was at this bonfire that vocalist Marti Dodson (then a junior at Ohio State University) and rhythm guitarist Pat Buzzard first met and subsequently became friends. The pair began writing songs together and when the time came to record their work, local drummer Dak Goodman was recruited to help. The trio found something in each other, and the decision was made to form an actual band. Booking their first show, they took the name Saving Jane from a cartoon Dodson had been doodling one late night at the studio. As the band slowly began making a name for itself around Columbus, an additional lead guitarist, Kris Misevski, and a borrowed bass player from Goodman's cover band rounded out the group. About a year later, tensions within the band lead to the departure of their borrowed bassist, and Jeremy Martin replaced him in 2002. Two years later, as Saving Jane found their style shifting more from acoustic roots to alternative rock, their manager insisted that Dodson be emphasized over the rest of the band; these changes eventually led to the exit of their lead guitarist. In February 2006, Mike Unger stepped down from Saving Jane for family reasons, and Brandon Hagan joined the band as a replacement, while keyboardist Joe Cochran who completed the lineup, left in late 2006.

The Confederate Flag is neither of the two. One main reason people think the flag is racist is because the \"KKK\" flew the flag so they think its racist but that's not true. The main stream clan does not fly the confederate flag in fact the leader of the clan years ago actually sent out a memo to certain clans to not fly the confederate flag because they did not want to be associated with it. In fact the American flag is flown to this day by the \"KKK\". That was their original flag and they still fly it today. Most people think the Confederate Flag is bad because it flew over slavery, However the same could be said about the American flag because it actually flew over slavery for seventy years before the Confederate States of America even became in existence, The Confederate Flag never flew over the ships that brought the slaves over to America. The Confederate States of America released all of their slaves in 1863, While the federal union didn't do it until 1868, With the passage of the 13th amendment. People call it the \"Rebel Flag\". To be perfectly honest it wasn't the south that rebelled it was the north under president Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln rebelled and over threw the government that was given to us (The Confederate States of America) in 1787. the south tried to maintain that government by succeeding from the Union and thus lead on until the Civil War.\n\n\n~ Dictated But Not Read, Kason Stanley and Jacob Proffitt"}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Saving Chinesecrested.no", "description": "A group has been created to work on saving www.chinesecrested.no.

I would really like to help the NHS make all of these things happen because PEOPLE WANT THEM! I would like to hear from any endocrinologists / nurses or anyone else in the medical profession who is willing to listen to me and discuss peoples concerns without being defensive and viewing me as a busy body who is not wanted or needed (it seems like them and us at the moment) because their are clear issues and 1,356 people agree as do the 10,000 people who have signed my petition to develop the epipen i just want to help make this better so my child and other people like her can live a safe happy and healthy life ...... Thank you \n\nA copy and paste of the epi pen campaign\n To Develop a life saving pen injection for all steroid deficient children and adults\nWhy is this important?\n\nMy little girl who is 14  has been diagnosed with hypopituitarism, thus meaning her pituritary gland is not  working affecting many glands in her body. \nThe most serious being her adrenal gland, she is now cortisone dependent which means she needs to carry a life saving emergency injection everywhere she goes. Because this condition is quite rare there is not a quick pen injection like the epi pen or diabetes pen. This means that in a time of crisis a small glass bottle containing cortisone is snapped opened a syringe is drawn up with the medication, a sterile needle is taken out of the packet and then attached to the said syringe. This is then injected intramuscular in to the leg.\n I am very sure that my little girl in a close to unconscious state would not even be able to take the top off  the little glass tube let alone draw it in to a syringe and then inject it in to herself but this is  what she would HAVE to do to save her own life if she were alone. Im terrified to let her out of my sight. Even I worry that in this situation as a parent I would not be able to calmly do this. I know many other mothers and sufferers also feel this way, it seems that it is not viable  because there are very few people with this condition which gives the impression that their lives are not as important as those who suffer with diabetes or fatal allergy sufferers. \nUltimately I would like my little girl to finally have a normal life, she has suffered with very poor health for the past 14 years, she has gone through so much and come through so much I think now she deserves the right to a more  healthy life with the safe knowledge that no mistakes can be made in saving her life in an emergency situation. This injection pen could mean life or death to all of these people. \nPlease consider listening to my plea, I do not want to use my daughter in any publicity stunts or news stories to promote this campaign because she is going through / has been through enough. Hearing the story of how she could die any minute without an emergency injection is not something I want her to be continually listening to and I would never use her in this way. \nI know saying that will make this pettition even harder because no one wants to see a mother blabbing on about it, that does not get much sympathy or capture anyones imagination, I know they would rather see a cute little girl with a potentially life threatening condition telling her own story. I am not prepared to do this but will do anything personally in my own power to make it happen, everyone deserves the right to life. All other pettitions and campaigns have fallen on deaf ears. So please everyone get behind me and show your support. Ill quote in my daughters own words from when she was 3 suffering double pneumonia in hospital on Christmas Eve. \n'Mummy its not fair any more like this'\nPlease listen this time\nYours sincerely\nRachel Pegler.\n"}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Saving Sierrabelle", "description": "Sierra was rescued from the shelter by Sasha's Hope and Rescue on August 23, 2014. She had the worst case of mange the shelter had ever seen. She was emaciated, dehydrated, anemic, and near death.

Here is a brief timeline of her first two weeks with me.   \n-Saturday August 23: I pick Sierra up from the shelter.\n-Sunday August 24: I take Sierra to Peachtree Corners Animal Clnic where she is evaluated and treated by an amazing staff. \n -Monday August 24: Sierra develops diarrhea. She had tested negative for parvo at the shelter, but was still vulnerable to the disease, so PCAC sent Sierra's angel vet tech Carly Landry out to my house to retest for parvo. Still negative.\n -Wednesday August 27: Sierra developed a very slight cough. \n -Thursday August 28: Sierra heads back to PCAC for severe cough and develops diarrhea in the vet office. Tests positive for coccidia (previously negative...has to do with the life cycle of the bug) and is diagnosed with upper respiratory infection. \n -Friday August 29: Sierra's breathing worsens and we decide to begin nebulizer treatments. Angel Carly Landry comes to the house with meds, and Sarah Couch Davis delivers me a nebulizer macine out of thin air.\n -Saturday August 30: Sierra meets her next Angel, Xena the Warrior Puppy's momma, who posts Sierra's story on her page and increases awareness and donations for Sierra. \n -Saturday August 30, PM: Sierra begins coughing up brown fluid and I take her to a 24 hour emergency clinic. Within 20 minutes of arriving, both Carly and Xena's mommy arrive to stay with me. Sierra is diagnosed with severe pneumonia and must be hospitalized. Brown fluid = pus and blood from her lungs.\n -Sunday August 31: I pick Sierra up from the 24 hour emergency vet and transport her back to PCAC for further evaluation. Sierra's next angel steps into her life when Dr. Jackson decides she will take Sierra home over the holiday weekend to monitor her closely and continue her on IV antibiotics and fluids.\n -Tuesday September 2: Sierra comes back to my home and seems to be recovering nicely.\n -Thursday September 4: Sierra develops yellow drainage from her nose and darker staining on her puppy pad and I transport back to PCAC for evaluation. She gets repeat chest xrays and medication modification.  \n-Friday September 5: Once again, Sierra seems to be resting nicely. She will go back in on Monday for repeat chest xrays and medication modification. She will stay on antibiotics for 4-6 weeks after radiographic resolution of her pneumonia. We had to take her off her meds for the coccidia because she is currently on eight different meds and her system cannot handle another at this time. She has come a long way in 14 days, but still has quite a long way to go.\n\nSome people may wonder why we spend so much money and time and effort into saving one very sick dog when that money and time can be used to save so many others.

Songwriter, lead vocalist and rhythm guitar player J.J. Otero, explains the stories behind these songs:  \n\nReservation Boy\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid, I was always listening to the AM radio station that was broadcast all over the Navajo reservation. I would hear old country greats like Chet Atkins, Patsy Cline, Wil Rogers. It wasn\u2019t til years later that I realized that those great songs were coming from a place further back in music history. I heard Ralph Stanley, Ernest Tubbs, and Bill Monroe for the first time in my early 30\u2019s and absorbed as many songs and documentaries as I could find on that style of \u2018ol\u2019 timey music.\u2019\n\nAfter viewing a documentary on Ralph Stanley, I sat down and started writing a song with that bluegrass vibe. It\u2019s as though I could hear all the harmony and instrumentation parts right then and there. A few days later, my friend Carlo Johnson and I sat down and recorded on a cheap microphone and my laptop and so Reservation Boy was born.\n\nBeing proud of my heritage and where I came from is the notion of this song. Because of reservation economics, I had to leave the reservation for school and work and the song talks about me missing my mom and dad.  The song also pleads \u201cso mama/daddy please don\u2019t leave me in this lonely city.\u201d\n\nIndian Girl\n\n\u201cAt the end of a 7 year relationship, I found myself single and unsure of myself in the game. I had a lot of time on my hands and spent quite a bit of it in downtown Albuquerque at the music venues and eateries. During that time I was smitten with a beautiful Jemez Pueblo girl who was waitressing at a diner.  After several lunches, dinners, and breakfasts,  we became friends. \n\nI started to think more and more about her and she was the inspiration for this song. \u2018I see you there so beautiful, I hear you laugh wonderful, I feel your presence so comfortable. Indian girl. I see you walk so gracefully, I hear sing so tenderly, I feel your body right next to me.

And you probably have too. As an author, speaker and seminar teacher he brings a lifetime perspective to the \"real world\" life of faith as very few can.\n\nTurbulent times require extraordinary faith.  Or better yet, turbulent times require the faith that Jesus walked and talked about for three years of public ministry.  Jesus talked about a sower, a king, a slave, and a leper, yet most of us have never seen or met one of them. But those were the situations that people of his day understood.\n\nTom Fay looks at the financial and home foreclosure crisis and uses it to describe the same faith that Jesus taught. So whatever your personal crisis is today: debt, illness, death, job, school, family, marriage, etc. there is an answer in the faith that Jesus taught. So often he said, \"Your faith has healed you.\" This book is about that faith.\n\nIs Faith Really Relevant for Your Problems?\n\nJesus talked about the faith of a mustard seed to move a mountain into the sea.  So surely our faith today should be able to move a mountain of debt.  Can God pay your mortgage?  Will the bank accept your \"faith\" for payment?  Mr. Fay shows both biblically and from experience that yes, faith does make mortgage payments.\n\nThis is not a \"feel good\" book. This is not a \"name it and claim it\" book. It is a hard-hitting study of what the genuine Christian faith is all about.  The author looks at faith as an action and not a religion.  Faith requires an action on our part\u2014and it produces an action on God's part. \n\nFinally an Author Who Has Been There!\n\nTom Fay shares the pains, worry and doubt that confronts most of us when embarking on a life of faith.  But he doesn't share it in a sterile laboratory, but in real life.  He has been though it and survived.\n\nBut What If This Book Could Change Your Life!\n\nAnd after having gone through great struggles of faith we find that we have an \"anchor\" that holds us during the next and larger crisis.  The author explains what that anchor might look like and what it can do as a life altering event.\n"}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Island Savings", "description": "Island Savings, a division of First West Credit Union, offers British Columbians on Vancouver Island, Pender Island and Salt Spring Island innovative products, an extensive branch network and local decision making.

She has been fighting this disease for so long, that they can no longer afford all the expenses associated with treatment, traveling, and medications. Over the past 8 years, this terrible disease has caused a tremendous drain on the family, both mentally, physically and financially. She may not be able to receive the needed treatments if we don't find a way to raise money for her continued care. \n\nMy mother has not only had to fight the disease, but also has faced many obstacles along the way because she did not receive the proper medical treatment in the beginning. \n\nIn 2006, she had a lumpectomy to remove a DCIS & also received 38 rounds of radiation to her left chest area. \n\nIn 2008/2009, she was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. She had a double mastectomy & started reconstruction. She received 8 months of different chemotherapy drugs, including Adriomycin, Cytoxan, Taxol, and Taxotere. She was very ill during her treatment, and lost all her hair. \n\nIn 2009, she had reconstructive surgery. \n\nShe has also had numerous surgeries in addition to these. She had to have ports put in chest twice. She has had to have 2 lumps removed from the left side of chest.\n\nIn 2012, she had another reconstructive surgery because an MRI showed there was a rupture in her right implant. The surgeon also found left over breast tissue that had to be removed.\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, the PET scan showed that the cancer had spread to several areas. So my mother went through chemotherapy again. The doctors tried to shrink the tumors before surgery, but the chemo did not help much. This time she was given Gemcitabine and Carboplatin\n\nIn October of 2012, our mother had surgery to remove lymph nodes under arm. The surgeon said she was full of cancer. It had spread so bad that it was inside and outside all the lymph nodes they removed. The cancer was also in all the flesh, veins, & muscle they removed. The surgeon could not get it all, and left several inoperable tumors around her brachial plexus and 3 lymph nodes in her neck. The surgeon closed her up, and told our family that she was terminal, and there was nothing else they could do. He said he was sorry.\n\nSo in January and February of 2013, our mother received radiation again. The doctors said you should never radiate the same area twice, but the cancer would do worse than the radiation. If they had to operate on the tumors around her brachial plexus, which is the nerves and artery supplying blood to you arm, that they would most likely have to amputate her arm. And since she was terminal, they did not want to put her through this. Numerous doctors at Vanderbilt have told her that the goal of treatment is Quality of life, not Quantity. \n\nMy mother was put on a clinical trial last year. In December of 2013, the CT scan showed she had 15 tumors in her liver. It turns out, she was getting the placebo instead of the real drug. So they started the real medication in January. But then she had complications with lungs and had to be taken off of it. She developed pleural effusion, which means fluid builds up in the lining of the lung. They initially drained over 3 pounds of malignant fluid off left lung. After doing this several time, they put a chest tube in so she could drain the fluid out at home every 2 days. \nThey say she is now developing fluid in right lung also. And the last count showed she had 25 tumors in her liver. \n\nThe doctors had to change her chemo once again, so she has been taking 7 pills a day call Xeloda for months, hoping it would slow the growth of the tumors. \n\nHer scans last week showed that the tumors are all growing, and there are more of them. She also has more tumors in liver and lungs, and the others grew since last scan. She has several other tumors throughout her body. \n\nOur mother had an appointment today to start chemo, but was unable to go due to finances. She needs to go to Vanderbilt to get a new chemotherapy once a week, and they are going to biopsy her liver. She is hoping to be able to go next week, and they are working with her to switch her appointments around.\n\nThis has been going on for eight years, and now they are in need of prayers and donations of any amount to help with all the expenses of medical bills and traveling expenses. \n\nANY PRAYERS OR FINANCIAL SUPPORT IS GREATLY APPRECIATED!"}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Saving Paws Rescue, Inc.", "description": "We believe that there is a home for every animal, no matter what.

I have been going through some medical issues myself and am in school and knew I could not take another dog in (I have two rescues).  Every week I went back to volunteer at the shelter, there she was, along with this black un-neutered male dog \u2013 living in a mostly fallen apart box trailer in a large vacant desert lot.  Although they were very dirty and looked like they\u2019d been on the streets a while, the two dogs were VERY sweet toward me and the people in the shelter and their kids.  Occasionally, the homeless shelter would let her and the black dog into their parking lot area \u2013 which was usually closed.  Her tail was always tucked and very gentle.  Just wanting to tuck her head into the arm or body of a person \u2013 totally seeking comfort.  \n\nOne time \u2013 a couple weeks after meeting her, when I got there to volunteer, Bria was worse than ever and the black dog was badly beat up.  There were new dogs there too \u2013 bigger unneutered males that looked like they had homes but jumped a fence because of the scent of a female.  The new ones were hovering all around her \u2013 wouldn\u2019t leave her alone, even though she only wanted to be with the black dog (her first friend) \u2013 the other dogs wouldn\u2019t let her.  Knowing I couldn\u2019t keep her, I knew I had to get her out of there or she would end up pregnant or worse and not make it through the hot desert summer.  Another volunteer took the black dog to an emergency animal hospital and he was then transferred to the Humane Society for medical treatment \u2013 he is currently stable there.  It was so hard pulling the little black dog out of where he was hiding because he was hurting badly and had a systemic infection, but we got him out and he showed no aggression, was just scared to death that he was getting into a car with someone he didn\u2019t know \u2013 while in the car, despite all his wounds and looked like broken leg, he still crawled from the back seat into her lap.  He fell over on his side on his way into the emergency animal hospital.\n\nBria came home with me that night.  I couldn\u2019t leave her there in the physical condition she was in, in that horrible place with no food, water and shelter in the middle of the desert summer.  I thought she was probably in heat and that\u2019s why all the boys were there \u2013 I knew I had to get her spayed right away.  She had never been in a car before and she kept trying to crawl into my lap and ducking under every overpass (incredibly curious with new sounds) \u2013 but overall she trusted me and so she did well.  Then, coming into the house took 30 minutes.  When she came in she was walking very low on her belly and only because I was coaxing her with chicken.  She clearly had never been in a house before.  She didn\u2019t know what this house thing was all about!!  I gave her huge hugs and rewards for coming in.  Going in and out of doors was tricky for her the first couple days.  She is finally getting the hang of it.  ;)  Right away I had to give her a bath \u2013 thankfully a friend helped me with that.  It took two hours. Like I said she was in bad shape \u2013 cuts, bite wounds (new and old), ground in dirt in her fur and skin, etc.  Truckloads of dirt came off her.  The water initially scared her, but in her good natured, sweet way, she adjusted (putting peanut butter all over the tub didn\u2019t hurt either ;).  Then pouring the cup of water over her for the first time was also frightening for her, but she accepted it \u2013 again peanut butter on the tub helped.  For her, the best part was definitely getting dried off!!!  Oh how good she looked and felt!!  Now she could explore the house with some sparkle in her coat\u2026  what an expedition that was for her\u2026  Walking with tail tucked, looking in each room and exploring.  It was beautiful to see her loosen up as she began to realize she was in a safe place.  She was starving and gobbled down the food I put out for her \u2013 I put my hand in her bowl while she was eating, she did nothing \u2013 did not even tense up.  I pulled the food away while she was eating, she was perfectly behaved (even though she was starving) \u2013  also, she does not tense up when other dogs get around her food either.  Once that was done, I put frontline on her to make sure she was tick and flea free.   For the first time in her short little life, she felt safe and zonked right out.  I took pictures of her at this point \u2013 to document her wounds so that someone could be held accountable if they ever came forward.   \n\nThe next day I introduced her to my two dogs and she immediately was thrilled to see them, especially the boy.  I could tell it eased her even more.  She particularly took to my boy \u2013 she cuddles up next to him whenever she can.  I also took her with me to the Humane Society to see if we (her and I) could beg for a spay appointment asap.  I didn\u2019t want her to get pregnant.  They took us the next day and also gave her all her vaccines, tested for heartworm - negative, and did other deworming just as a precaution.  Although it is not a good time for me, I put it all on my credit card.  I just want her to get a very loving and responsible, forever home.  Her personality is like she dropped from heaven.  She could easily be a therapy dog.  \n\nI did not know she was very early in pregnancy until after the spay.  But, what was developing (looked like 11) had mostly already passed because she was not nourished enough to carry.  It was so sad, but nothing we could do and it could have seriously injured or killed her.  When I picked her up they said she may feel hormonal because this was more complicated than most spays.  But, even after all this, today she is the same old love bug to me, my dogs, and the neighborhood kids.  She is still resting up quite a bit as is to be expected.  \n\nShe is the sweetest thing on four paws.  I have had lots of fosters \u2013 none like this.  She is a one in a million dog.  \n"}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Saving Her Elegance", "description": " S.H.E Inc.  is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which was founded in March of 2015 by two sisters born and raised in Detroit MI.

Our primary role is to save lives on the beach and our 129 Surf Life Saving Clubs protected more than 8.5 million beachgoers last season.\n\n\nSurf Life Saving NSW is the largest surf rescue organisation in Australia. We are a network of volunteer surf lifesavers, professional lifeguards, support operations and drowning prevention infrastructure and systems.\n\nSaving Lives\n\nThe NSW coastline is a beautiful, dynamic and sometimes dangerous place. More than 21,000 active surf lifesavers patrol our beaches on weekends and public holidays each season (September-April).\n\nVolunteer Surf Lifesavers\n\nAn iconic sight on Australian beaches for more than a century, volunteer surf lifesavers are recognised world-wide and provide a unique community service.\n\nSurf lifesavers are easily recognised by the famous red and yellow cap, and their bright red and yellow uniforms.\n\nEmergency Response System\n\nCoordinated through the SLSNSW State Operations Centre, the system has been responsible for saving hundreds of lives over the last few years, most outside of patrol hours or at unpatrolled and sometimes extremely remote locations.\n\nA team of dedicated volunteer State Duty Officers are the backbone of the operation, responding to callouts 24/7 from Police or Ambulance, tasking the most appropriate Surf Life Saving assets to the scene of coastal accidents or emergencies.\n\nIncidents range from swimmers in distress, rockfishing mishaps, shark attacks, seaches for missing persons, offshore boating accidents, coastal aircraft crashes, lost kayakers or medical emergencies.\n\nProject Blueprint\n\nSurf Life Saving NSW has embarked on a major project to help reduce coastal drowning deaths by assessing every beach and rock platform in NSW over the next few years.\n\nThrough the NSW Water Safety Black Spot Fund, Surf Life Saving NSW is using the expertise of Australian Coastsafe, a wholly-owned business unit of Surf Life Saving Australia, to complete the project.\n\nAn average of 92 people drown in Australian coastal waters every year. New South Wales (NSW) accounts for almost 50% of the national coastal drowning toll. Project Blueprint hopes to contribute to meeting the States goal of a 50% reduction in drowning deaths by the year 2020.\n\nLifeguards\n\nThe Australian Lifeguard Service NSW is an independent division of Surf Life Saving which provides professional lifeguard services to local government, private corporations, sporting organisations and community groups.\n\nSports\n\nSurf sports competitors are also skilled and proficient surf lifesavers. Encouraging involvement in surf sports and offering opportunities to compete for both elite and grassroots-level athletes, helps provide clubs with a steady stream of fit and motivated patrolling members.\n\nMajor surf sports events such as the NSW Surf Life Saving Championships bring thousands of members together to enjoy the true spirit of competition and camaraderie, in many cases forming friendships which last a lifetime.\n\nEach year events including the State, Country, Interbranch, Endurance, Pool Rescue and IRB Championships involve many volunteers, months of preparation and rely on the skills and experience of hundreds of officials, coaches and team managers to be a success.\n\nSurf Life Saving NSW has a comprehensive Surf Sports Development Plan which offers tremendous opportunities for athletes, coaches, mentors and officials to develop skills and improve performance. \n\nSurf Life Saving is much more than just saving lives on the beach. A key priority for us is reaching out to all Australians through Community Education.\n\nWe aim to teach all Australians how to keep themselves and their families safe at the beach. We do this through:\n\nSpecifically targeted campaigns eg. rockfishing, rip currents, multi-lingual surf safety. See more on beach safety\nSchool education programs eg. Beach to Bush\nSurf Ed programs delivered by our Branches and licensed providers\nCommunity courses eg. First Aid, CPR, Junior First Aid... More info on courses\nEngaging the community at fairs, open days, festivals\nCoastal Accommodation Network provides surf safety brochures and information to hotels, resorts, backpackers and camp grounds.\nSupporting our Members\n\nSurf Life Saving supports our 75,000 volunteer members in a variety of ways. We assist clubs and members in recruitment and retention, membership reporting and statistics and a range of member protection initiatives.\n\nThe junior activities or \u2018nippers\u2019 program is huge in NSW and we provide resources and assistance to clubs to help them deliver the program to more than 30,000 members under the age of 14.\n\nWe also run a number of member development programs which offer personal development and leadership training. These include:\n\nJunior Lifesaver of the Year (22 finalists from across the state aged under 14 years)\nYouth Opportunity Makers Workshop (members aged between 15 and 17 years)\nDevelopment Networking Program (members aged between 18 and 25 years)\nMember recognition is very important and our annual Awards of Excellence recognises outstanding achievements from all areas of Surf Life Saving. We also recognise our volunteers through external award programs such as the NSW Volunteer of the Year, NSW Sports Federation Awards and Coastal Environment Awards.\n\nSupporting club operations and activities is also an important role and we provide a range of resources such as the Club Guide, Quality Clubs Program and Governance and Best Practice support. We also assist clubs with their environmental initiatives, culturally and linguistically diverse groups as well as disability programs.\n\nEvent Services\n\nWater Safety and Rescue Services\n\nThe Australian Lifeguard Service is the largest provider of aquatic rescue services in NSW. Our Lifeguards and rescue personnel are highly skilled and trained to provide support services at most sporting, cultural or community events.\n\nOur professionals can be contracted for events such as regattas, ocean swims, film shoots, school excursions and picnics, birthday parties, swimming carnivals and other public or private events.\n\n\nFirst Aid Services\n\nSurf Life Saving NSW has a large team of professional First Aid Officers and Lifeguards who can provide emergency First Aid services at most sporting, school, cultural or community events."}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Saving EMILY", "description": "We have created \"The Emily Fund\" in honor of Emily and will save and help other animals in need of medical care."}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Saving Leon", "description": "Leon has been living on the streets for over a decade.

From her simple act of kindness, others were moved and emboldened, and what started as a single meal for a big ol' redhead with a smile from eye-to-eye turned into a shopping trip for warm clothes, and a night in a hotel, then a week in a hotel, to where we are today.\n\nIn this short time, the community has rallied together to feed and clothe him, as well as keep a roof over his head.

Dames Saving Danes is the combined vision of three 'Dane Savvy' women who all share a common passion for these gentle giants, the world\u2019s biggest dog with hearts to match.\n\nOur years of experience in rescuing Great Danes tell us that there are still many out there who are in need of and deserve a second chance at life. Rescued Danes come from a wide variety of backgrounds ranging from abandonment, neglect or abuse, as well as owner surrenders. Unfortunately more often than not, Great Danes end up the victim of their family's inexperience or all too busy lifestyle, and develop behavioural issues as a result of spending too much time alone and without adequate exercise. Due to their giant stature, strong leadership as they mature is key, as without it they are unfortunately one of the first breeds to end up being surrendered to a shelter environment, moved from one inexperienced family to another, or worse, sold or given away sight unseen and improperly matched to an owner via the internet. \n \nFor the reasons expressed above, our main priority is to adequately assess and match each Dane in our care to the most suitable family for that particular Dane, while taking the applicants family composition and home environment into consideration. As we know from personal experience, it takes so much more than just an enclosed yard to dedicate the time, the commitment, and the heart required to adequately care for a Great Dane. To ensure that each Dane has the best possible chance at a permanent home, every Dane's personality and behaviour is assessed on intake, and a path for their rehabilitation and training is planned. Any health or veterinary needs are also attended to. Each dog goes through a period of rehabilitation, whether it is in an approved foster home or on our farm with a 'Rehab Pack' of four Danes who excel at teaching these rescued dogs things they may have lost along their way into rescue. For some who carry scars from their past life, that may mean learning how to trust again, how to play, and just how to be a dog. Our \u2018Rehab Pack\u2019 of Danes has a very special power in helping us humans to transform the extremely broken souls much faster and farther than we alone ever could. Our mandatory rehabilitation brings each Dane back to health, optimal behaviour and overall condition prior to their adoption through proper nutrition, natural supplementation when needed, veterinary care, training and adequate exercise.\n  \nThe success of our program centers on our dedicated volunteers and our exceptional commitment, dedication and ability to match each Dane with the right person or family. All applicants go through an extensive screening process to determine their suitability and lifestyle. We have found that in the majority of cases there is a Dane to suit most homes. For successful applicants who are committed to providing the necessary daily requirements like proper nutrition and plenty of exercise, every effort is made to find them the perfect dog. Our meticulous selection process also ensures great care is taken especially when matching Danes with families with small children and/or other family pets.\n  \nDames Saving Danes is funded entirely from donations, fund-raising and adoption fees that serve to support each Dane while in our care, which includes addressing their nutritional and veterinary needs. Health permitting, all intact Danes will be spayed/neutered, vaccinated, as well as any emergent health issues addressed and treated prior to their adoption. Once successfully adopted, Dames Saving Danes will continue to honor our commitment to the Danes and their adopters by making available health and training resources and recommendations as needed and by request to help ensure the permanency of their new home.\n\nDames Savings Danes strives to ensure that all of our rescued Great Danes are given a second chance at life, with their health, well-being and happiness being our main goal. \n"}, {"ori_label": 32, "name": "Saving Christmas", "description": "Saving Christmas is a 2014 American faith-based comedy film directed by Darren Doane and written by Doane and Cheston Hervey.

She almost didn't make it the first night she was in the hospital. Two days later there was suspicion that she had leukemia. Our family had battled cancer with a child before. My oldest son, Jonah, was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma in 2006. After almost a year of chemo and amputation of his leg he was cancer free and has been ever since. Making the choice to amputate was the hardest thing our family had ever faced and we felt very alone. I didn't want other families to feel as alone as we did, so I began reaching out to families. I was soon hired by Oklahoma Family Network and I began a support system for families who have kids diagnosed with cancer. It's now called Families Fighting Childhood Cancer. So, I was visiting the hospital when child life told me about Joy's situation. When the diagnosis of leukemia was confirmed, I asked who would take care of her.  Her parents had been arrested for her neglect. I texted my husband, Jeremy, asking if he would consider caring for a little girl in DHS custody, his one word reply was \"Absolutely\". I called the social worker on my way home, offering to help if we could. It was a whirlwind from there...DHS home visits and paperwork and BAM! I was staying with her in the hospital less than a week after she was diagnosed. Beyond the cancer diagnoses, Joy was facing extreme delays. She was almost three years old and had never walked, only spoke less than 10 words, and was extremely weak. Joy has been undergoing chemotherapy treatments and attending therapies to help her recover. A year after we began caring for her we were blessed with the opportunity to adopt her and make her name officially Joy. We chose \"Joy\" because when we met her she was withdrawn, but now if you meet her she exudes the word joy and it's contagious! Joy is our youngest child of four.  Our other children are Jonah, Judah, and Joanna. If you \"like\" this page you will be kept up to date on her care and progress.

And most certainly burros, their wild counterparts, suffer under the same attitude. But we never thought so. While visiting the Bureau of Land Management's wild horse and burro short term holding facility in Palomino Valley, Nevada, we immediately fell in love with the burros. This facility houses an average of 50 burros at a time that were rounded up from public lands throughout the West. Most of these animals never get adopted. We adopted 3 as soon as we purchased our new home. And that is where Zoe and Lexie's story begins.\n\nZoe's mom Lexie was rounded up from her home in the southern Nevada desert in July of 2013. We adopted her from the BLM Palomino Valley Center shortly after on August 8th, and brought her home a month later with two other burro friends.\n\nLate this winter, we noticed that Lexie may be pregnant. We thought we had a lot of time to prepare for the new arrival. But we had a surprise on April 2. The baby needed a plasma infusion on day 2 because she was not getting enough colostrum from her first time mom. On day 4 we noticed that she was walking on the toes of her hind legs. She was given veterinary treatment for this as well. One of the complications was a wound that went around her pastern. The wound was not getting better, and the tendons were not improving either. One night we called the emergency vet out to the ranch. The wound was treated and the legs were splinted to control the tendons. She was worked on for three days by the veterinarians here at the ranch, but the condition was not improving. She was taken to the house of another caring vet (Dr Ian Lafoon of Large Animal Veterinary Services), so that she could be cared for on a continual basis and she stayed there for 3 weeks. The tendon issue was resolved, but unfortunately the wound did not. Despite much care and speaking with other specialists (Dr Jolly of Step Ahead Farms), the foot needed to be amputated. Equines, unlike smaller animals, can not survive with three legs without putting enormous stress on other areas of the body. So Zoe also needed a prosthetic in order to survive and lead a normal life.\n\nWe were going to make the decision to put her to sleep, but watching her romp, gallop, and buck around the paddock, seemingly unaware of the injury and not exhibiting any pain, nuzzling people, and almost getting in your lap to be loved on, changed our minds, and we began searching for other options.\n\nThis was not an easy decision to make. We have done an enormous amount of research on whether this process is not only fair, but will provide her with a normal life. We are also aware of the care involved after we get her home. Speaking with other donkey owners that have gone through the same experience ( Baby Bella's person Stacey), and with specialist Dr Ted Vlahos at Rocky Mountain Equine Hospital in Sheridan, Wyoming we were given the confidence to proceed.\n\nWe started a Facebook page; Saving Zoe the Baby Burro, set up fundraising accounts, started receiving donations, found a driver and immediately left to make the 3 day 1400 mile journey all the way to Sheridan, Wyoming. They were amazing travelers, and we were so relieved to arrive in Sheridan and get them into the hospital. By the time we arrived home, Zoe's page had 600 likes and because of the kindness of people who donated, we were able to pay the deposit for the surgery.\n\nThe first surgery went extremely well, and Zoe was fully weight bearing on the temporary prosthetic leg right away. She was continuing to improve, and we were sent videos of her running and bucking. But then another unexpected and mysterious tragedy happened. A small wound had developed on the other hind leg, and just as before, did not heal normally. It became necessary to amputate the other foot as well. We were devastated and very confused. One prosthetic was challenging enough and two would be twice as much to care for and twice as expensive. Because of their love for Zoe and Lexie the hospital staff encouraged us to go forward and donated the cost of the second surgery. Again the surgery went very well, and now Zoe is walking on her hind legs without pain probably for the first time since she developed the condition. If all goes as the doctors expect, Zoe will be the first successful double amputee equine. While there have been three other cases of equine double amputees, unfortunately these horses died due to completely unrelated causes. We are hoping that Zoe, due to her small size and age, will be a trailblazer for many equines to come.\n\nWe also think that maybe Zoe could be used as a therapy animal for humans facing the same challenge, as well as increasing the knowledge about equine prosthetics, and donkey health (TMR's the Charlie Project). Our top wish is that Zoe becomes an ambassador for her species by bringing more public attention to the plight of the wild burro and encouraging more adoptions of these wonderful animals. We can't wait to bring them back home!\n\nThese are expensive surgeries and she will need to stay at the hospital getting adjusted to the prosthetics for a few months. The costs range from 5- 8,000 dollars for the hospital plus 3,000 for each prosthetic, and we have spent thousands already trying to fix her leg.\n\nWe have rescued or housed rescued horses (65 of them) and have never asked the community for help. But now, although it is difficult to do, we must in order to save Zoe. \n\nPlease consider making a donation and sharing her page. We also will have a silent auction album that will be added to indefinitely. We thank you all so much for the support and encouragement we have received through the entire process. Please continue to follow our journey.

I get an hour for lunch and usually go home, but today I had all intentions of going to CVS and doing some other errands. So I got in my car and something for some reason took me on my route home. About a mile from home I saw this little kitty sitting along the road. As I made eye contact with her I could see her meowing. I kept going and looked in my rear view and noticed she was still there and didn't scurry off. So being the animal lover I am I threw it in reverse and went back. I called my mom in a panic not knowing what to do. She just kept meowing at me with her big doe eyes. I tried to get her off the road... blowing the horn and saying get off the road kitty. She still didn't move. So I got a stick from along the bank and was going to try to poke her and get her to move. Sometimes cats can be mean so I wasn't sure if she was sick or rabid. As I turned back around I noticed she tried to get up and I could see a pretty big gash in her back leg. I knew right then and there what needed to be done. This cat needed me!! I had a blanket in the back of my car so I scooped her up and put her in the hatch and drove to the Dr Lewis. I told her the whole ride that she was going to be OK. So I rushed her into the vet in a frantic panic. My mom followed closely behind to meet me there. We got her back in the room where I explained to them that I found this precious little girl along the road. They asked me what I wanted to do? I looked at them without even thinking twice and said SAVE HER. As this poor little thing laid on the table while they were looking her over she rolled on her back wanting to play with her little motor just running. Now mind you she had just been hit by a car and she was purring wanting to play. I knew this cat was a survivor and had the will to live. So they put her on a heating pad to keep her warm because she was so cold after being left for dead laying along the road in the pouring down rain. My mom and I sat in the waiting room while they prepared to do an X-Ray to see what was going on. Dr Rachel Teribury who has been amazing and on the case from day one gave us some pretty disheartening news about what this little girl had gone thru! She had 2 fractured front legs, a cracked pelvis, an out of whack right hip and not to mention the huge gash on her hind leg. So again I was asked what do you want to do? And my answer remained the same without thinking twice.. SAVE HER!! So as they prepared to work on my little girl my mom and I left and I returned back to work. I have a pretty amazing boss who understands my crazy ways especially when it comes to animals. All I could think about that afternoon was is she going to make it out of all this! Well this was just the beginning. Dr Rachel called me later that afternoon and explained she made it thru the surgery just fine. So when I went to pick her up Saturday I was taking home a kitty with 2 casts on her front legs and an out of whack hip and cracked pelvis. They said she was going to need LOTS of TLC. And that's just what we have been giving her.  She needed to be confined from my other animals just so they didn't want to play with her or jump on her or anything. Mind you we have 4 dogs and 4 cats so it's not exactly quiet here in KiskoVille. LoL! So we set her up a kennel with lots of soft blankets and a heating pad to keep her temp up. She slept a lot the first 48 hours bc she was still coming down from the sedation and prob the shock of it all. So Sunday rolled around and we kept trying to feed her and she didn't want anything to do with it. I had a big Sunday dinner prepared that day that included a roasted chicken!! Hmmm this def appealed to her. She ate a whole plate full. Later in the evening she kept meowing which she hadn't really done since she had been home. We would come to find out that when she meows and squirms around it means it's time to potty. So she peed like a big girl for us. We have to hold her up under her belly for her to go bc with 2 broken front legs it's kind of hard. Monday morning comes around and we get up and guess what... She slipped a cast off. So we took her to the vet where they would reset it. She is a little bugger. Everything is going good except for this smell I kept smelling.I have the nose of a bloodhound so I smell everything. We take her back to the vet and they check her right leg where it is coming from and discover it is dead. No blood supply. We knew from the get go that it could be a possibility she could lose a leg. So she came home minus one leg. It hurt my heart so bad that she had to go thru this, but she is a darn trooper and it didn't kill her spirit at all. She continued to be her perky self and kept on purring, eating, drinking and going to bathroom. I knew it was going to be a ton of work bc we need to feed her and help her potty. But I have an amazing husband and family who have been with her since day one. When you have help it makes things so much easier. We don't have children so my 9 animals are my babies. Then it was Wednesday October 30th and we noticed that her skin up at the top of her cast on her left arm had looked a little red and sore. So my husband cut some of the cast so it wouldn't rub and we cleaned it with peroxide. We took her to the vet Halloween morning and they looked at it. At 9:23am I got some devastating news from Dr Lewis, he told me that the other leg was dead! I was speechless and heartbroken and mad all at the same time. I asked him what he thought we should do. He suggested putting her down bc a cat with only 2 back legs really wasn't an option bc what would her quality of life be like. And also the financial part of was a big factor. I called my mom devastated and so broken and asked what I should do. My husband was working out of cell range so he wasn't available. I haven't cried that hard since I found out my pap was diagnosed with cancer! That morning was a complete blur. We called Cornell University but they couldn't tell us anything over the phone and they couldn't get us in to even see her until December. Everything internal with Gracie was fine. So as far as her quality of life in that matter she was perfect!! When I look into Gracie's eyes I see a survivor. So it was on.... SAVING GRACIE!! I told them to do whatever they had to do to save her. I told her October 11th she was going to be OK and I don't break my promises!! So they amputated her left front leg. I called down to the vet to check to see how she was doing and if she was comfortable. Steph the tech who also has been a godsend told me that she had rolled herself over and had her head perked up AND she ate an entire bowl of food!! This cat has got the will to live!! I felt so much happiness in my heart when they told me that.  So she came home today November 1st minus 2 legs.

The wind was so strong, the noise deafening with metal, wood, concrete, cars and gunk flying through the sky.  It seemed to last forever.  Why was my face hurting?  The monster made something hit me in the face..oh the pain.\n\nI was lost, alone, no food, water, shelter, no family and was terrified.  Animals were buried and running around everywhere.  I must learn to survive.  What can I do to keep these strangers and animals from hurting me?  All I can do is bark, growl and snarl.  I will scare them so they stay away and not harm me.  Now I am being dragged by something on my neck into a building.  There are so many animals who also look lost and afraid.  Don't touch me!  I am afraid.  My bark and growl does not seem to be working.  My instinct tells me to use my mouth but not too hard. \n\nWho is this smelly lady sitting in front of my cage?  Her smell is peaceful and calming.  She seems to take my stress away.  The smelly lady and man are not afraid of me.  Wait, she is opening the door to my cage.  The smell of her hands are grounding to me.  She talks very loving to me.  I feel acceptance of her and believe their is hope for me.  This is my person.  People call her Bev.\n\nBev makes sure I am cared for.  When she comes to the pen in the warehouse where I am isolated from other people and animals I feel JOY.  When she walks away I cry.  I see the other animals getting shots and medicine.  I am coughing more as each day goes by.  The short time I got medicine does not make my cough better.  I feel so alone and hopeless.  I hear the other people yell things when my person takes me for our daily walks.  They yell \"angry dog\" and tell my person you better not let that dog near me or I will kick the **_* out of her.  I am glad they are afraid but it makes my person sad.  I really want to experience forgiveness and surrender myself to allow a human to love me, but I still just get so scared.\n\nWhere are all the other lost animals being taken.  Why am I left back here in the corner?  I am alone.\n\nWait, my person Bev is back!  She and my other friend Lindie are taking me somewhere.  Oh boy!  Car ride.  Perhaps there is HOPE.  \n\nFrom Bev: We fostered Goldie to keep her from being euthanized.  We are not the perfect solution for her forever home.  I love this girl dearly as does my husband.  Being in our home she has been allowed to heal emotionally and physically.  She loves essential oils and is learning what it means to experience love.  We have now turned to Timm Williams and Jennifer Dale, animal behaviorists, Ruff Life Rehab to work with Goldie on her fear nipping and dominance behavior.  She does not do that with mom but sometimes nips dad.  For her to be the best she can be, she needs his help to accept and love all people and animals.  Will you help us help Goldie?

Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements.EtymologyThe origin of the word \"travel\" is most likely lost to history. The term \"travel\" may originate from the Old French word travail. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil). In English we still occasionally use the words travail and travails, which mean struggle. According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words travel and travail both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means \"three stakes\", as in to impale). This link reflects the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Also note the torturous connotation of the word \"travailler.\" Today, travel may or may not be much easier depending upon the destination you choose (i.e., Mt. Everest, the Amazon rainforest), how you plan to get there (tour bus, cruise ship, or oxcart), and whether or not you decide to \"rough it (see extreme tourism and adventure travel). \"There's a big difference between simply being a tourist and being a true world traveler,\" notes travel writer Michael Kasum. This is, however, a contested distinction as academic work on the cultures and sociology of travel has noted."}, {"ori_label": 12, "name": "Travel Channel", "description": "COMMENTING POLICY: The Travel Channel Facebook page is designed to be a friendly, inclusive community for our friends and fans to talk about our programs and all things travel.

The series was produced by Warner Bros. Television.Traveler was officially canceled after eight first-run episodes on July 18, 2007. Fans then tried to save the show but were unsuccessful. David DiGilio, the creator, posted an \"answers blog\" on September 28, 2007, which officially ended the show.SynopsisThe series follows Jay Burchell and Tyler Fog , two graduate students who become suspects when the fictitious Drexler Museum in New York is bombed while they are pulling a juvenile prank. It appears that their friend and roommate, Will Traveler , has framed them for the bombing. Afterwards, Traveler disappears and there is no evidence that he ever existed. Jay and Tyler flee from the authorities, who believe them to be domestic terrorists. While on the run and trying to clear their own names, they attempt to delve into Will Traveler's past in hopes of discovering Will's motives for turning on his friends.Meanwhile, Traveler goes on a similar search for answers. It is revealed that he is in fact a secret agent working for a division of the Department of Homeland Security called the Fourth Branch, and slowly a complex conspiracy is unraveled.Jay and Tyler reunite with Will by the seventh episode, and together the three attempt to bring those responsible to justice. They manage to kidnap Jack Freed, director of the Fourth Branch, but before they can use him to clear Jay and Tyler's names, the limousine with Jack Freed in it explodes."}, {"ori_label": 12, "name":

In Japan they often go by the moniker FTB.They were connected to Japan's counterculture movement and noted for their mixture of early heavy metal with psychedelic and progressive rock. They received wide acclaim from critics but failed to achieve commercial success and disbanded in 1973 to pursue individual careers. The band reunited in late 2007 when hippie influences became popular again in Japanese fashion, music and cinema; it was permanently disbanded after the 2011 death of vocalist Joe Yamanaka.While the band's releases have never sold well they continue to be held in high regard by the music industry. Their albums have never been out of print and they continue to be made available on new audiophile formats such as SHM-CDs. The former members of the Flower Travellin' Band continue to perform FTB songs live together under the name Flower Power with other musicians.HistoryThe band was initially started as a side-project by Yuya Uchida when he returned to Japan after visiting his friend John Lennon in England in the mid 1960s, where he was introduced to various upcoming artists such as Cream and Jimi Hendrix. Yuya wanted to introduce a similar sound to the Japanese, and formed the \"Flowers\" as a cover band with various group sounds musicians, and two vocalists; male singer Chiba Hiroshi and female singer Remi Aso. They released the album Challenge! in 1968, featuring covers of songs by Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Jefferson Airplane and Big Brother and the Holding Company, in addition to an original song.

I didn't come home until 18 months later. Once back, I knew I couldn't go back to my old life or a typical job - I wanted to travel. I wanted to make this my life. Three months later, I was on the road again and I haven't stopped since.\n\nThis website is not only a chronicle of my travels but also a way for people to find inspiration, travel tips, destination advice, travel news, and beautiful photos. People always say to me how much they would love to do what I do, even if it just for a little while.  I'm here to tell you you can. I'm here to show you how. Travel doesn't have to be an expensive task nor does taking a long term trip require you to uproot your existence. Forget what the ads say!

travel literature include Pausanias' Description of Greece in the 2nd century CE, and the travel journals of Ibn Jubayr (1145 - 1214) and Ibn Batutta (1304 - 1377), both of whom recorded their travels

The genre was called 'travel record literature' (youji wenxue), and was often written in narrative, prose, essay and diary style. Travel literature authors such as Fan Chengda (1126\u20131193) and Xu Xiake (1587\u20131641) incorporated a wealth of geographical and topographical information into their writing, while the 'daytrip essay' Record of Stone Bell Mountain by the noted poet and statesman Su Shi (1037\u20131101) presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose."}, {"ori_label": 12, "name": "ISTTE - International Society of Travel and Tourism Educators", "description": "We are a nonprofit international organization dedicated to improving the quality of education and research in the travel, tourism and hospitality industries by promoting the exchange of information, ideas, and outstanding service to our members.

Generally, holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or tradition of cultural or religious significance. Holidays may be designated by governments, religious institutions, or other groups or organizations. The degree to which normal activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job being held, or even personal choices.The concept of holidays has most often originated in connection with religious observances. The intention of a holiday was typically to allow individuals to tend to religious duties associated with important dates on the calendar. In most modern societies, however, holidays serve as much of a recreational function as any other weekend days or activities.In many societies there are important distinctions between holidays designated by governments and holidays designated by religious institutions. For example, in many predominantly Christian nations, government-designed holidays may center around Christian holidays, though non-Christians may instead observe religious holidays associated with their faith. In some cases, a holiday may only be nominally observed. For example, many Jews in the Americas and Europe treat the relatively minor Jewish holiday of Hanukkah as a \"working holiday\", changing very little of their daily routines for this day.The word \"holiday\" has some variance in meaning across different locales. In North America the word refers to widely observed days of rest and recreation, whereas in the U.K. and many Commonwealth nations the word refers to any extended period of recreation. It is this first, more restricted sense of the word that concerns this article.EtymologyThe word holiday comes from the Old English word h\u0101ligd\u00e6g (h\u0101lig \"holy\" + d\u00e6g \"day\"). The word originally referred only to special religious days. In modern use, it means any special day of rest or relaxation, as opposed to normal days away from work or school."}, {"ori_label": 13, "name": "Vacation ZA", "description": "At Vacation ZA we are enthusiastic about moulding your travel needs and wishes with our extensive experience and knowledge gained through our partners.

People often take a vacation during specific holiday observances, or for specific festivals or celebrations. Vacations are often spent with friends or family.A person may take a longer break from work, such as a sabbatical, gap year, or career break.The concept of taking a vacation is a recent invention, and has developed through the last two centuries. Historically, the idea of travel for recreation was a luxury that only wealthy people could afford (see Grand Tour). In the Puritan culture of early America, taking a break from work for reasons other than weekly observance of the Sabbath was frowned upon. However, the modern concept of vacation was led by a later religious movement encouraging spiritual retreat and recreation. The notion of breaking from work periodically took root among the middle and working class.EtymologyIn the United Kingdom, vacation once specifically referred to the long summer break taken by the law courts and then later the term was applied to universities. The custom was introduced by William the Conqueror from Normandy where it facilitated the grape harvest. In the past, many upper-class families moved to a summer home for part of the year, leaving their usual home vacant."}, {"ori_label": 13, "name": "Exploring Vacations", "description": "Exploring Vacations specialise in Self-Drive Tours, Private Escorted Tours, Coach Tours and City Breaks for Ireland, Scotland and The UK "}, {"ori_label": 13, "name": "Honeymoon Vacation", "description": "Honey Vacation is an established travel agent operating in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

It is the fourth installment in National Lampoon's Vacation film series, and was written by Elisa Bell, based on a story by Bell and Bob Ducsay. The film stars Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo and Randy Quaid, with Ethan Embry and Marisol Nichols as Griswold children Rusty and Audrey. The film opened at #4 at the box office and grossed over $36.4 million domestically. Vegas Vacation became the first theatrical Vacation film not to carry the National Lampoon label or a screenwriting credit from John Hughes.PlotAt work, Clark Griswold has invented a long life food preservative, earning him a large bonus check. Clark announces to his family that he is taking them on vacation. Enthusiasm wanes, however, when Clark says they are headed to Las Vegas, Nevada. His wife, Ellen and teenage daughter, Audrey have their doubts, as Las Vegas is not known for its family-friendly atmosphere, while teenage son Rusty appears to be more eager. Upon travelling to Vegas, they run into the \"girl in the Ferrari\" who appeared in the first film.

The TV movie follows the McDonald-Venturi family as the children are forced to spend part of their summer vacation with their grandmother at her lodge. It was announced on Family Channel and French-Canadian channel VRAK.TV in March 2010 that the movie would premiere on June 25, 2010 in Canada, while December 12, 2010 is listed in the trailer for the US, but never actually aired when it was supposed to. However, the movie finally began airing on Starz Kids & Family in January 2011 in the U.S. A commercial on Nickelodeon Australia stated that it would premiere on June 19, 2010. A commercial on TG4 stated the Irish premiere would be on the channel Thursday October 28, 2010 at 5:10\u00a0p.m., part of the channel's Mid-Term Halloween movie week.PlotCasey and Derek are back but nothing has changed, they are still at each other's throats, and still have sibling rivalry. The only good thing about it all is that it's summer vacation, and everyone is planning on going on a trip to Casey and Lizzie's grandmother's lakefront lodge for the summer. But their plans get a little messed up when Derek is forced into going by his dad. Things get even more messed up when Casey has to ride with Derek to the Blue Heron Lodge. On their way up there they get pulled over by the cops, meanwhile Edwin, Lizzie, Marti, Nora and George have already arrived. They soon find out that when Nora's mom said she wanted her grandchildren to visit, she meant her blood grandchildren, but agrees to let them stay, while George and Nora head for Montreal. Soon Derek and Casey get to the lodge but get stopped by Edwin who informs them about what's happened. After this, Derek says he wants to leave, Casey takes his keys, and he starts running after her. That's when Derek meets Felicia. One thing leads to another and Derek stars dating the competing lodge's daughter, then he soon realizes that it wasn't the best thing to be doing, and he breaks up with her. Meanwhile, Casey meets Jesse, a waiter at the lodge dining area, and they both love to dance and start dancing. Meanwhile Edwin gets hurt, Lizzie meets a guy, and Marti finds a lizard. Soon one thing leads to another and they end up trying to save the lodge and they succeed. At the end they have a dance party, and it shows the ending credits then shows it a year later when the first McDonald-Venturi is born. They named him Simon, and everything is well, and everyone lives happily ever after."}, {"ori_label": 13, "name": "Vacations To Costa Rica", "description": "My Costa Rica (www.VacationsToCostaRica.com) is a travel agency located in San Jos\u00e9 that specializes in custom vacation packages to Costa Rica.

First published in 1776, the book offers one of the world's first collected descriptions of what builds nations' wealth and is today a fundamental work in classical economics. By reflecting upon the economics at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the book touches upon such broad topics as the division of labor, productivity, and free markets.HistoryThe Wealth of Nations was published 9 March 1776, during the Scottish Enlightenment and the Scottish Agricultural Revolution. It influenced a number of authors and economists, as well as governments and organizations. For example, Alexander Hamilton was influenced in part by The Wealth of Nations to write his Report on Manufactures, in which he argued against many of Smith's policies. Interestingly, Hamilton based much of this report on the ideas of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, and it was, in part, Colbert's ideas that Smith responded to with The Wealth of Nations.Many other authors were influenced by the book and used it as a starting point in their own work, including Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus and, later, Ludwig von Mises. The Russian national poet Aleksandr Pushkin refers to The Wealth of Nations in his 1833 verse-novel Eugene Onegin."}, {"ori_label": 42, "name": "IGrow Wealth Investments", "description": "The IGrow Property Investor Club was founded in 2006 by Jacques Fouch\u00e9.\nThe IGrow Investor Club, together with associated companies, provide services that include education in property investment, financing, risk management, accounting, structuring, the administration of trusts, rental management and financial planning.\n\n"}, {"ori_label": 42, "name": "Elite Wealth Advisors Ltd", "description": "The official Facebook page for Elite Wealth. \n\nElite Wealth Advisors Limited, established in 1990 is one of today\u2019s upcoming equity research and broking houses of India.

Yet as we progress, as we evolve, as we go along, those are the words used to describe what we are doing. In our mind, it seems like we are following a path, a linear kind of thing, as step-by-step, a foot before a foot kind of situation. Yet it isn\u2019t a path we are on, it is an experience of application. The spiritual path is about application. Think about how a plant grows. You take the seed. You apply certain conditions \u2013 the right soil mixture, the right water mixture, the right temperature for it and that seed starts to soften and open and split and grow. It grows because it takes from the environment and becomes completely different expression of itself. Such growth is a magical occurrence that happens all the time around us. That kind of evolution is exactly what our spiritual path is like.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Some of the photos on Health Wealth Happiness Success (c)  I have created myself.

"}, {"ori_label": 42, "name": "Art of Mindful Wealth", "description": "Hello and welcome! My name is Leisa Peterson and I am a wealth coach and founder of WealthClinic, a global community for learning, sharing and mindfully expanding our experiences with money. I am really glad you are here!\n\nPart of our mission includes sharing the importance of having greater mindfulness in all that we do.\n\nMindfulness is our innate ability to be present and to pause before we react to the challenges of our busy lives. As opposed to mindlessness, a mindful person pays greater attention to and has more control over their actions of body, speech and mind which helps them to become a better leader, partner, friend and co-worker.\n\nOur history begins with the convergence of two diametrically opposed worlds: spirituality and finance.\n\nAt first glance, nearly everyone thinks these two worlds are complete opposites. Because at best, spirituality is grounded in love and compassion. And at its worst, finance is fueled by greed. But what I eventually discovered is these two worlds are direct reflections of each other.\n\nTo understand how, let\u2019s rewind a bit\u2026Back in 1999, I was enjoying a successful career in the financial world. That same year, a family tragedy occurred. To help me heal, I started studying spiritual philosophy and trying to meditate. That\u2019s when I began straddling the two worlds.\n\nAs soon as I began looking introspectively, I felt pulled to learn and practice more. At first I attended retreats, signing up for longer ones each time. Eventually, I taught others how to meditate and use mindfulness in their day-to-day lives.\n\nDuring that time, I was also working for a large bank where I witnessed (and participated in) the euphoric economic rise of the mind-2000\u2019s. Followed by the fiscal meltdown of 2007-2008 and the painful aftermath of the Great Recession.\n\nThis front row seat to mayhem caused me to ask many questions like:\n\nWhy do we repeatedly engage with money in very unconscious ways?\nWhy does money, at times, cause us do stupid and silly things?\nIs there a way to stop this behavior by applying mindfulness to money?\nSince I couldn\u2019t find anyone to answer these questions (from either world), I decided to figure them out on my own.\n\nI\u2019ve always loved research, so I dove deeply into researching the answers. But with each psychological study, expert interview, or book I read\u2026my questions grew. After years of study, I ended up with more questions, but no concrete answers.\n\nEventually, in my position as a financial adviser, I started asking my clients about their personal experiences with money. That\u2019s when the pieces of the puzzle really came together. I combined their feedback with principles from psychology, sociology, biology/neurology, and philosophy. Then added my 22 years of working with money to my 15+ years of personal spiritual development.\n\nIt took all of this to create the comprehensive system we apply at WealthClinic. People using the system see quick, dramatic and positive changes in their experiences with money and much more.\n\nI believe the fact it took insight from so many fields reflects the complexity of money in our modern lives. It\u2019s no wonder we keep repeating our limiting and damaging money behaviors, no matter how hard we try to change!\n\nAfter watching so many people use our process, here\u2019s what really blew my mind\u2026When we change our experiences with money and learn how to see it with a new lens, we throw a new door wide open. A door to life fulfillment (and greater prosperity!) that often remains undiscovered and closed. But when you open that door, life changes in bigger and better ways than we can ever imagine.\n\nUnlike other wealth building programs that merely tell you to change your money mindset and then everything will improve, WealthClinic programs teach you exactly HOW to:\n\n#1. Improve your inner game, change your money mindset, and take your wealth building habits to the next level,\n\n#2. Own your whole story so that you become the creator of the life you want to live,\n\n#3. Create a money mind map for where you want to go, why you want to go there and how you are going to get there, and\n\n#4. Implement your strategy using a broad range of tools and mindfulness based exercises that support your success in a way that fits perfectly for YOU!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about our wealth mastery programs, you can sign up HERE for a complementary \u2018Wealth Accelerator\u2019 30 minute discussion where you\u2019ll learn the #1 thing holding you back from creating mindful wealth and the steps you can take to create both financial success and greater fulfillment.\n\nNamaste,\nLeisa Peterson, MBA, CFP\u00ae\n\nP.S.

It led me to a 25+ year career on Wall Street, where I became a Regional Vice President at a large investment firm and was responsible for a territory producing more than $200 million in annual investment sales. But, at the same time, I noticed I was actually building money faster at home by using my own strategies. I became a multi-millionaire at age 39 and was unexpectedly widowed a few years later, which set me on a mission to teach financial freedom in a unique way.

Our focus for many years has been to provide Wealth through property and during this time I most definitely can see that women seem to worry more about their finances than anyone.  My role is to educate all women, whether they are married, divorced or loving the single life to a position of confidence around Finance.  Coupled with a great team of specialists and a good dose of nurturing and hand holding, we thought it was time to expand our Think Money network and work even more closely with women in this extremely important area.\n\nWith statistics now showing that there are nearly as many single parent families as what there are with a mum, dad and kids, it's becoming more and more apparent that single people do not feel they are being catered for or even heard.  I would like to think that Think Wealth 4 Women becomes an education forum for women to share their knowledge and most importantly learn how to better run their financial area of their lives.  This is my passion.\n\nThink Wealth 4 Women like Think Money, will focus on Mindset and education.  We believe that for the most part of any journey at any point in your life it is all about Mindset.  If you have the right mindset you can tackle anything.    I have been fortunate in my life to have a natural ability to be able to apply myself to any given task and get the result I desire, if not at first most definitely after one or two attempts.  These milestones like many other peoples have been significant and quite frankly could have gone either way.  I could have quit and said too hard, or do what I did which was pick myself up, dust myself off and find someone who I could learn from to get what I want.  I did this, I still do it and I am very pleased to say I have that and much much more of what I want.\n\nThink Wealth 4 Women for me is the nurturing spot of Think Money.  I absolutely love helping anyone get their finances in order and assist in lifting their lifestyle to where they want it to be.  Anyone can learn this information and I feel privileged to have a company complete with a sensational team of people that believe in integrity and educating others.\n\nI invite you to become one of our Think Wealth 4 Women, come learn how to get your finances in order.

It needs to separate the TWO words of \"Wealth\" and \"Creation\".  To Tony Lim, a word \"Wealth\" is not only refer to monetary term.  It is symbol of achievement not only from money perspective, it is a meaning need to look from multi-dimention such as from Academy, Family, Religion, Career as well as Wealth (Money). \n\nTony Lim reads a person is considered \"Wealthy\" when he/she has achieved a rounded achievement from Academy, Family, Religion, Career, Health and Wealth (Money).  \n\nPeople always mislead by the materialistic world by determining wealth from only CASH/Money term.  It is a wrong perspective.  A true wealth will only forming when a person matches his/her achievement on all rounded from Academy, Family, Religion, Career, Health and Money.  \n\nThe reason is a wealthy man who is rich in CASH doesn't mean he is living in a happy life or practicing a good personality.  A real wealthy man should be living a balance life in all perspective.  Therefore, Wealth Creation is created to educate and train all mankind included Students, Teachers, Preachers, Managers, Employee, Employer, Investors, Traders and etc.to achieve a real wealth in their life. \n\nPeople always forget about a lifespan of human-being.  We tend to believe living is forever.  But, the matter of fact is WE CAN'T END OF LIFE ALIVE!  Therefore, we should find out the purpose in our life and to strive to achieve it.  It is called fulfillment.  Life is not only about living only, is about feeling of fulfillment in life makes a person to be different. \n\nThe second word of \"Creation\" means creating a life for a life.  During the time, we were born a count-down clock is formed.  If, we are not going to create a life that belong to us.  It will seem like \"Sailing Without A Compass\".  Sooner or later, we will get lost.  The worse case, we will be living according to other people, country, friends, relative and society judgement.  To judge whether are we considered successful or wealthy from their perception and judgement.  \n\nWhy do we need to live from other people judgement?  As well as not by the life we wish to live as?  Therefore, Wealth Creation will be helping all mankind to find out their true meanings of life and assist them to create their own world to live on.  At the end of the day, fulfillment will be difference from one to another.  \n\nWealth Creation will help to create a TRUE wealth to us and enjoy the best life we could ever live! \n\nWarmest regards, \nTony Lim \nMaster Trainer & Speaker of Wealth Creation Technology (WCT)\nCertified ACTA Trainer from Singapore\nCertified CES in Real Estate at Singapore\nThe Numerologues Practitioner\nAuthor: The Powerful Value Investing Formula\nMaster Trainer & Speaker from WCT\nFounder of WCT & Programs: 1) Know Yourself, Control Your Destiny & 2) Your Secret Codes To Success!"}, {"ori_label": 42, "name": "The Wealth Of The Wicked Layed Up for The Just Transfer", "description": "Bishop Eric V Sharpe, Pastor, Author, Radio Network Owner, , Presents Dynamic Teaching On The Transfering of The Wealth Of The Wicked Back Into The Hands Of God's People.

They can lead an eager crowd through a rabble-rousing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll number & then in a blink of an eye, beatbatter their ears with some bone-shaking bluegrass, only to flip the script on them again moments later with a feast of funk. They\u2019re no strangers to the blues or jazz, and swing is definitely their thing. Ska is no faux pas, they\u2019ve got a little punk in their trunk, some metal in their kettle, and have been known to tropically testify with dubstyle & roots reggae. Even old school country, afrobeat, hip hop, and middle eastern sounds have all reared their decibels in the all-inclusive sound wave pool known as Bum Wealthy. The impressive part is how they can make that wavepool (with such an eclectic range of styles) still transition seamlessly and retain a pop sensibility, all the while flowing smoothly without making those who choose to earsurf it seasick. The end result is an amalgamation of sound so inviting that the boys were invited to play an unexpected second set at 2010's Spring Hookahville. One listen to their new album, Cardboard Kingdom, and you'll understand why these musical chameleons, have played shows with such greats as Michael Franti, Government Mule, Ekoostik Hookah, Keller Williams, Badfish, One Under, The Spikedrivers, Assembly of Dust, Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey, Rumpke Mountain Boys, The Werks, Papadosio, Zach Deputy & many many more. The only thing more esoteric than the band\u2019s sound is their instrumentation. In a single night, audiences can witness these shapeshifters shuffle through guitars, keys, organ, drums, saxophone, trombone, trumpet, mandolin, banjo, washboard, jawharp, bouzouki, sitar, cigar box guitar, accordian, harmonica, slide whistles, & kazoos all without missing a beat. Formed in 2001, the band has carefullly crafted their sound the past 9 years under the radar, slow-cooking their songs to perfection before finally releasing their debut, Bumpercrop in 2007. Their upcoming sophomore release Cardboard Kingdom portrays the band\u2019s music at it\u2019s full potential. The album was recorded by Ben Miller at Central City Recording, and mastered by Brian Lucey (who has mastered both The Black Keys grammy award-winning album, \"Brothers\", as well as Dan Auerbach\u2019s\nsolo album and many other renowned artists.

Investment fads, hidden fees, and rising taxes are relentless.

For a 170 years now, the industry leaders have been insisting on remunerating representatives in such a way that it spawns the wrong behaviour... sales targets! We, at Revolution Wealth believe this approach is fundamentally flawed!\n\nSelling or driving monthly sales targets should NOT be the approach to financial planning\u2026it should however be solutions driven through creating, long lasting, solid relationships with clients as to assist them over time to achieve their wants and needs.\n\nWhy Revolution Wealth?\n\nWhen analysing your current financial situation we get a better understanding of the scope of work involved before presenting you with our findings based on your financial circumstances, however, it is far more important to understand how the \u201cstatus quo\u201d in terms of your financial situation, fits into your greater financial goals, priorities and aspirations, than simply doing the number crunching. \nTo get a handle on this, we would have to meet again to discuss your wants and needs. Put simply: help me establish what you would like your money, to do for you? This will help us to conduct a \u201cGAP\u201d analysis i.e. the gap between where you are now...and where it is, you want to be?\n\nThere are few certainties in the world of financial planning, but here is one: the actions you take today determine the lifestyle you lead in the future.\n\nOur vision at Revolution Wealth is clear:\n\nWe believe in assisting clients to create wealth. \nTo help create a living financial plan in everyone\u2019s life that will empower you to make the right financial choices so that you can effectively formulate & achieve your lifestyle goals, reliably over time.\nWe are committed to an advice led, fees based, client centric, lifetime, financial planning process.\nLifestyle financial planning offers clients an improved way of determining a tailored financial plan, helping them to achieve their long-term goals reliably. Core to our approach is a genuine focus on the client, rather than on selling a financial product. Every client receives a customised living financial plan incorporating his or her lifetime goals and current situation. This plan is reviewed on a regular basis by your \u201cfinancial coach / planner\u201d.\n\nThe coaches\u2019 approach and process starts by addressing the personal aspirations and goals of each client and builds every client's personal financial plan on this very sound and client-specific foundation. In many ways, it turns the traditional financial planning model on its head. This model calls for an advice led, fees-based approach to financial planning, something that very few financial planners embrace.\n\nAt Revolution Wealth we embrace this philosophy, we will endeavour to understand exactly what it is you would like to achieve, and set out to make certain recommendations that may lead to implementation.\n\nA simplistic example of this may be for instance -\u201cfamily protection\u201d (the goal) \u2026 i.e. at date of death you may want your wife to have R5000 p/m to look after herself and the children, should she re-marry, her new spouse must not be able to spend your kids maintenance or \u2018education fund\u2019. The implementation of my recommendations could potentially be\u2026 to draft a new will in such a way that the provisions of a \u201ctestamentary trust\u201d at date of death caters for the kind of protection you were looking for. Understand that certain recommendations may lead to implementation\u2026 that may have a financial implication now, for example, the cost of setting up a new will."}, {"ori_label": 42, "name": "Wealth Trend Corporation Limited", "description": "Wealth Trend Corporation Ltd. was established in 2007. \n\nWe are a fast growing distributor of gadget clip cases and accessories, offering the latest collections from international major brands.\n\nWe have established strong relationships with retailers throughout the region. \n \nWith headquarter in Hong Kong, our sales network covers Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, China, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia.\n\n"}, {"ori_label": 42, "name": "Royale Beauty Health Opportunity Wealth by: Filbert D.
